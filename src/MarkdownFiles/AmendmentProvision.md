# Amendment Provision under Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act 1956

## SECTION 6

This section discusses the devolution of interest in coparcenary property.

1. **In a Hindu Family governed by Mitakshara law**:
   - **a)** The daughter of a coparcener shall:
     - Become a coparcener in her own right by birth in the same manner as a son.
     - Have the same rights in the coparcenary property as she would have had if she had been a son.
     - Be subject to the same liabilities with respect to the coparcenary property as she would have, had she been a son.
   - **b)** Any reference made to the Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to include a reference to the daughter of the coparcener too.
   - **c)** Any property that a Hindu female is entitled to by virtue of birth shall be held by her with the incident of coparcenary ownership and shall be regarded as property disposed by her by testamentary disposition.

2. **Where a Hindu dies after the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act of 2005**:
   - His interest in the property of the Joint Hindu family, governed by Mitakshara law, shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession and not by survivorship.
   - The coparcenary property shall be deemed to be divided as if a partition had taken place, provided that:
     - **a)** The daughter is allotted the same share as is allotted to the son.
     - **b)** Shares of predeceased son or predeceased daughter, that the child would have gotten had they been alive at the time of partition, will be allotted to the surviving child of the predeceased daughter or son.
     - **c)** The share of a predeceased child of a predeceased son or daughter will be allocated to the child of such predeceased child.

3. **After the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act of 2005**:
   - No court shall recognize any right to proceed against a son, grandson, or great-grandson for the recovery of debt due from his father, grandfather, or great-grandfather solely on the grounds of pious obligations under Hindu law.

   - **If the debt was contracted before the commencement of the Amended Act**:
     - The rights of the creditor to proceed against the son, grandson, or great-grandson are not affected.

4. **Exclusions**:
   - Nothing in this section applies to a partition effected before 20 December 2004.
   - In a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, a daughter of a coparcener shall by birth become a coparcener in the same manner as the son and would have rights in the property as she would have had if she had been a son, including rights to claim by survivorship and subject to the same liabilities that a son would be.

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - Property that a female Hindu will be entitled to by virtue of birth shall be held by her with the incidents of coparcenary ownership and can be disposed of by her by will or testamentary disposition.
   - The right is not applicable to a daughter married before or to a partition which has been affected before the commencement of the amended act.

## Historical Context and Amendments

- **Prior to the 2005 Amendment**:
  - The old HSA enabled daughters to obtain a share on a notional partition but allowed coparceners to will away their undivided interest, which often defeated daughters' interests.
  - The Vedic texts and traditional practices excluded daughters from coparcenary property rights, causing acute hardship and discrimination.

- **States' Influence**:
  - States like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra had laws ceding coparcenary rights to females by birth before the amendment.

- **Law Commission Report**:
  - The 174th Law Commission Report in 2000 highlighted the oppression faced by women and laid the groundwork for the amendment.

- **2005 Amendment**:
  - The amendment balanced property rights of both male and female siblings in coparcenary property.
  - It was held that since there was no express provision or implied intention to the contrary, an amendment dealing with a substantive right is prospective and does not affect vested rights.

- **Vineeta Sharma Judgement**:
  - Confirmed that coparcenary rights by birth do not require the father to be living as of 9.9.2005.

## Conclusion

From ancient times, Hindu womenâ€™s status has been subordinate to men. The initial Hindu Succession Act did not grant women coparcenary rights. The 2005 amendment revolutionized this, ensuring equal status for sons and daughters under Hindu Joint Family law. The amendment also considers the children of daughters as coparceners like sons. Despite its merits, ambiguities about adopted daughters' rights in coparcenary property remain. The 2005 amendment is a step toward achieving gender equality.
