# Section 10 of CPC and Its Applicability to Family Courts

## Section 10 of CPC

Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) states that no court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties or parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, where such suit is pending in the same or any other court in India or any court beyond the limits of India established or continued by the Central Government and having jurisdiction before the Supreme Court. 

### Conditions for Applicability:
- The subsequent suit must be directly and substantially related to the previously filed suit.
- The title, issue, and parties must be the same.
- The suit must be filed before a competent court of the same jurisdiction or a competent jurisdiction to try such suits either within the limits of India or outside India, or before the Supreme Court.

The entire subject matter of the two suits must be the same for the applicability of Section 10. When the same party files two or more cases on the same matter, the competent court has the power to stay the proceedings of another court. This section applies only to ongoing cases and does not prevent the court from making temporary injunctions or holds.

In the case of *Radhika Konel Parekh, AIR 1993*, the court held that two suits involving the same parties and subject matter should be stayed if they are pending in different courts.

## Relevance to Case

In this case, the plaintiff had earlier filed for Judicial Separation under a Family Court which remained pending. The plaintiff also filed a case in the Magistrate Court under the Domestic Violence Act 2005, followed by Section 125 CRPC seeking maintenance for the minor children. Additionally, the plaintiff filed for a Prohibitory Injunction restraining the defendant from meeting the minor children.

Section 10 of CPC, or the doctrine of Sub Judice, states that no court can proceed with the trial of any suit where the title, issue, and parties are the same while it is still pending in another competent court of the same jurisdiction. Since the proceedings were first instituted in the Family Court by filing for judicial separation, the plaintiffâ€™s subsequent suits in the Magistrate Court are contrary to Section 10 of CPC.

## Applicability of CPC to Family Court

### Section 10 of Family Courts Act, 1984

- The provisions of the CPC 1908 and any other law for the time being in force shall apply to the suits and proceedings before a family court. For the purposes of these provisions, a family court will be deemed to be a civil court and shall have all the powers of such a court.

### Section 7 of the Family Court Act, 1984

- A family court can exercise jurisdiction as exercised by any District Court or any subordinate Civil Court under any law at the time being in force concerning suits or proceedings. A suit or proceeding includes proceedings between parties to a marriage for a decree of nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, or dissolution of marriage.

### Section 18(1) of the Family Court Act, 1984

- A decree or order of the CPC passed by the Family Court shall have the same force and effect as a decree or order of a Civil Court and shall be executed in the same manner prescribed in the CPC for the execution of such decrees and orders.

## Relevance to the Case

Section 10 of the Family Courts Act of 1984 states that CPC is applicable to Family Courts. In this case, there exists multiplicity of proceedings due to the multiple suits filed in both the Magistrate Court and Family Court by the plaintiff against the defendant. 

Since CPC is applicable in Family Courts, Section 10 of CPC or the doctrine of Res Subjudice will be applicable to the case.
