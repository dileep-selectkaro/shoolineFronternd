**Law of Restitution CONJUGAL RIGHTS – Section 9, Hindu Marriage Act**

**What is Restitution of conjugal rights?** 

When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly.

**Explanation:**Marriage as an institution gives rise to a relationship between two partners: The Husband and the wife, which further gives rise to more relations. This relationship also gives birth to different sets rights and obligations. These rights and obligations cumulatively constitute’ Conjugal rights’ and can be termed as essence of the marital union. The term ‘Conjugal Rights’ in literal sense means ‘Right to stay together.’

It is a general accepted norm that each spouse should act as a support to other in hard times, should be there to comfort and love the partner. But if any of the partner leaves the other without any reasonable or sufficient cause, then the aggrieved party can knock the doors of the court to seek justice. Restitution of conjugal rights is the only matrimonial remedy available.

**ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 9:**

The decree for restitution of the conjugal rights may be passed in favour of an aggrieved party when:
- The wife or husband of such party withdraws from the society of the other
- The withdrawal is without any reasonable cause
- There should be no legal ground that why relief of restitution of conjugal rights should not be provided.
- The court is satisfied on the truth of the statements made in the application.

Therefore, only when the above-stated essentials are fulfilled the court grants the relief of restitution of conjugal rights. The word “society” in Section 9 has the same meaning as cohabitation, which means living together as husband and wife and fulfilling the matrimonial duties. Hence, where a party to the marriage stopsperforming the conjugal duties, it will amount to withdrawal from the society of the other.

Condition For Filing Complaint Under Section 9 of HMA
To file a petition for restitution of conjugal rights, it is necessary that the following conditions are met:

- The spouses must be living separately without any reasonable justification for the same.
- The affected spouse must have filed for restitution of conjugal rights.

Restitution of Conjugal Rights – Grounds For Rejection of Petition
A petition for restitution of conjugal rights can be rejected by the court in any of the following cases:
- When the spouse filing the petition has committed any matrimonial misconduct.
- When the respondent can claim any other matrimonial relief. Besides this.
- When the actions of the spouse are such that it is impossible for the couple to live or reside together.

Filing Petition of Conjugal Rights Under Section 9 of HMA A petition for restitution of conjugal rights can be filed with a Family court that has jurisdiction over the area where:

- The marriage ceremony was performed.
- The husband and wife used to reside together.
- The wife is currently residing.

An application is filed by the aggrieved spouse with the court having appropriate jurisdiction. The burden to prove that the spouse has left without any reasonable excuse lies on the aggrieved spouse.

The petition is evaluated by the court and if the court finds it to be valid then the court calls the other party to appear before it to present his/her side of the story/case.
After hearing both the sides and examining the facts and evidence presented before the Family Court, the court may order for restitution of conjugal rights by the way of attachment of the opposite spouse’s property if it comes to that. If the spouse fails to honour the decree of restitution of conjugal rights given by the Family Court, for a period of more than one(1) year, the aggrieved party gets a valid ground to file a divorce against him/her.
The aggrieved wife who does not want judicial separation can claim maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 without the need to file a separate maintenance petition. If the wife is unable to maintain herself during the case proceedings, then the wife can claim maintenance for herself and her children.


**CONCLUSION:**

The main object behind providing the remedy of restitution is that the sacramental bond of the husband and wife is protected and one is not denied the pleasure and company of the other. No doubt, it is the only positive remedy which is available under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which seeks to preserve the institution of marriage, yet the relief of restitution of conjugal rights has been criticized as being inhuman, barbarous, and infringing the privacy and personal will of a person. It is in the present scenario losing its significance. Noteworthy point is that this remedy has been abolished in England, from where such remedy was borrowed in India. Recently, PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court against the constitutionality of Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act,1955 on the ground that the courts force the separated couples to live together.
