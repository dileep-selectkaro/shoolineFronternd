# Bail in Cases of Cyber Crimes under the IT Act, 2000

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of technology has brought about a surge in cyber crimes, necessitating robust legal frameworks to address and combat these offenses. The Information Technology Act, enacted to deal specifically with cyber crimes in India, provides provisions for bail in such cases. This article delves into the considerations and processes surrounding bail in cases of cyber crimes under the Information Technology Act.

## Section 67 of the IT Act, 2000

Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 makes the publishing or transmission of obscene material in electronic form a punishable offense with imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of up to five lakh rupees for the first conviction. For a second or subsequent conviction, the punishment increases to imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to ten lakh rupees.

## Bail in Cyber Crime Cases

Bail refers to the method of releasing an accused person on furnishing a personal bond or surety to abide by the conditions imposed by the court and stand trial before the court. The purpose of bail is to ensure the appearance of the accused before the court whenever required. In certain cases, bail under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, can be granted only if the materials published or transmitted are not lascivious in nature or do not appeal to the prurient interest.

## Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000

Section 79 of the IT Act empowers law enforcement agencies to arrest individuals suspected of committing cyber crimes and outlines the conditions under which bail may be granted. Several factors are considered before deciding on bail in cyber crime cases:

- **Nature and Severity of the Offense:** More serious offenses may result in a stricter approach to bail.
- **Evidence and Investigation:** The strength of evidence and the progress of the investigation play a crucial role.
- **Flight Risk:** The likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice.
- **Repeat Offenders:** A history of cyber crime or related offenses may influence bail decisions.
- **Public Interest:** Protecting the public from further harm is key.
- **Cooperation with Authorities:** Willingness to cooperate can positively impact bail decisions.
- **Conditions Imposed:** Courts may impose conditions such as surrendering travel documents or reporting regularly to the police.

## Case References

### Sreekumar Vs. State of Kerala

In this case, the applicant made abusive posts on Facebook about a CPI(M) member's wife. The court ruled that even if the words were abusive, they could not be brought within the broad contours of penal provisions. The Kerala HC granted anticipatory bail, highlighting that for material to be punishable under Section 67, it must contain sexually explicit acts/conduct.

### Kaviyarasu vs State Of Karnataka

In this case, the accused sent obscene messages and photographs to the complainant's daughter, threatening to upload them on Facebook. The bail application was rejected.

## Policy Suggestions

The proposed model suggests amending the provisions on offenses in the IT Act as follows:

- **Financial Loss Ground:** Establish a ground such as financial loss to determine the offense's intensity.
- **Threshold Determination:** If the financial loss exceeds one crore rupees, the offense should be non-bailable. If below this threshold, the offense should be bailable.

## Conclusion

The article analyzes the issue of bail in cyber-crimes and proposes amending the statute to differentiate whether bail can be granted based on factors such as monetary loss limit, crime impact, and complexity. However, there are reservations about this approach, as judges may have discretion in deciding whether to grant bail. Additional deliberation is needed to quantify monetary loss limits and other grounds for setting thresholds. While this may be a drafting challenge, it will help prevent cyber-crime by making investigations more efficient and balancing the rights of the accused by providing bail in lower-intensity offenses.
