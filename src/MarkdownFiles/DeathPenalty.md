# Death Penalty in India: Legislative and Judicial Evolution

## History and Legislative Evolution

1. **Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898**:
   - Section 367(5) made the death penalty the default punishment for murder. A court had to provide written justification for sentencing to life imprisonment instead of death.

2. **Amendment in 1955**:
   - Removed Section 367(5), reversing the trend towards life imprisonment as the default punishment.

## Judicial Evolution

### Jagmohan v State of UP (1973)
- The Supreme Court rejected the first constitutional challenge to the death penalty. The court found that any incorrect use of discretion by judges could be corrected within the existing legal frameworks.

### Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
- Introduced a requirement for sentencing courts to record "special reasons" for choosing the death penalty over life imprisonment.

### Rajendra Prasad v State of Uttar Pradesh (1979)
- The Supreme Court defined "special reasons" to mean consideration of the offender's circumstances only, not the crime itself.

### Bachan Singh v State of Punjab (1982)
- Established the "rarest of rare" guidelines, emphasizing that the death penalty should be applied only in exceptional cases where no alternative sentences are possible.

### Shashi Nayar v Union of India (1992)
- Rejected the challenge to the death penalty, citing national law and order conditions.

## Present Context

- **Application**: The death penalty is applied in extremely rare cases. Since 2000, approximately 2,500 death sentences have been handed down.
- **International Perspective**: 70% of nations have abolished the death penalty.

## Crimes Punishable with Death Penalty

- **Sections**: 59 sections in 18 central legislations allow for the death penalty. 12 of these are under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
- **Homicide and Non-Homicide Offences**:
  - **Non-Homicide**: Includes 41 offences, such as rape, which can lead to the death penalty. 
  - **Homicide**: Includes 13 offences, such as murder.

### Notable Cases

- **Bangalore Church Blasts (2000)**: Eight prisoners sentenced under Section 121 IPC for "waging war" against India.
- **Shakti Mills Gang-Rape Case (2013)**: Three prisoners sentenced under Section 376E IPC for repeat rape convictions.

## Stages in Death Penalty Cases

1. Imposition by the Court of Sessions
2. Confirmation Hearing Before the State High Court
3. Proceedings before the Supreme Court
4. Clemency Request to the Governor or President
5. Writ Petition After Clemency Rejection

## Clemency Powers

- **Articles**:
  - Article 72: President of India
  - Article 161: Governors of States
- **Powers**: Remission, Commutation, Pardon, Reprieve, Respite. Multiple clemency petitions can be filed.

## Attempts to Abolish the Death Penalty

- **Pre-Independence**:
  - 1931: Private bill in the Legislative Assembly was rejected.
  - 1958 & 1961: Attempts in Rajya Sabha failed.
- **Law Commission Reports**:
  - 1967 & 1971: Reports assumed death penalty would remain, and the executive branch would have mercy powers.
