# Distinction Between Fast Track Courts (FTC) and Regular Courts

**By Vaishnavi Kakumani**

## Fast Track Special Courts (FTSC)

The right to a speedy trial is the essence of criminal justice, and justice delayed is justice denied. Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) were established to implement the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, and comply with directives from the Supreme Court. The Government devised a Scheme in August 2019, aiming to establish FTSCs, including exclusive POCSO Courts, for expeditious disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases. The Scheme was launched on October 2, 2019.

The Honâ€™ble Supreme Court of India, in suo moto Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 1/2019, issued directions for timely investigations and trials in POCSO Act cases. Each district with more than 100 cases under the POCSO Act will have an exclusive special court for these cases.

### Pros of FTSC

- **Procedural Expediency**: Designed to expedite cases through streamlined procedures and prioritization.
- **Caseload Management**: Focuses on specific types of cases, reducing backlog and expediting adjudication.
- **Time Frame**: Aims to dispose of cases within a shorter timeframe, setting strict deadlines and minimizing adjournments.
- **Deterrent Effect**: Swift case disposition can deter potential offenders, contributing to law and order.

### Cons of FTSC

- Temporary Scheme with no permanent infrastructure/asset creation.
- Limited scope and jurisdiction, excluding certain types of cases.
- Challenges in prioritizing cases, often influenced by political factors.
- Dependence on resources and infrastructure, potentially leading to inefficiencies.
- Risk of Miscarriage of Justice: Rushed proceedings may increase errors or wrongful convictions.
- Lack of Accountability: Accelerated pace may reduce transparency and accountability.

## Regular Courts

Regular courts, or district courts, are the backbone of the Indian judicial system, handling civil, criminal, and administrative matters at the district level. They follow standard legal procedures and often handle a wide range of cases, leading to significant backlogs and delays.

### Pros of Regular Courts

- **Adherence to Legal Procedures**: Ensures thorough examination of evidence and legal arguments.
- **Comprehensive Review**: Allows for detailed consideration of complex legal issues.
- **Opportunities for Appeals**: Provides avenues for appeal and higher court review.
- **Expert Judges**: Presided over by experienced judges, ensuring fair and impartial adjudication.
- **Protection of Rights**: Acts as guardians of individual rights and liberties, promoting a just society.

### Cons of Regular Courts

- **Prolonged Duration**: Cases often take years or decades to reach a final judgment.
- **High Backlog**: Overwhelmed by cases, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Resource Constraints**: Inadequate infrastructure and staff hinder efficient functioning.
- **Financial Burden**: Legal proceedings can be costly, particularly for marginalized communities.

## Conclusion

In India, the judiciary operates both regular and fast track courts, each with unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Regular courts play a crucial role in administering justice but face challenges like case backlogs and procedural delays. Fast track courts prioritize speed and efficiency, though they may compromise thoroughness and jurisdiction scope. Both court types must balance speed with fairness, accountability, and access to justice to ensure an effective and equitable justice system.
