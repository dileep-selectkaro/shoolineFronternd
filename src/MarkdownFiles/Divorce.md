**Divorce Mediation**

Divorce mediation is a new process in India where husband and wife will meet a legal third-party person who will help to resolve their dispute at the earliest. This mediation under an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is that the parties will not have to go through the legal process; instead, this process will help to resolve issues through methods such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. In a trial, someone else decides these issues, and once the judge decides, one party might be dissatisfied with the outcome. In divorce mediation, it is an amicable and mutual decision of both parties, resulting in a win-win situation. Additionally, there are significant cost savings in divorce mediation, such as not having to pay court fees, paper preparation costs, appearing in court fees, and advocate fees. The main advantage of divorce mediation is that it avoids delays, allowing you to conclude your divorce within a few sessions and save time.

Investing several years of life and money in divorce litigation is likely. Divorce litigation is not easy; it takes away your social life, health, and drains your emotions. These issues can be settled in divorce through mediation, which many litigants find less expensive and painful than the court process.

**Achieving Successful Divorce Mediation**

A divorce mediation is a private and confidential process facilitated by a neutral mediator to work out and settle the divorce between the parties. Here are a few steps to achieve successful divorce mediation:

1. Before entering mediation, as a litigant, understand the effects of your case and outline your issues in front of the mediator.
2. The primary aspects in divorce mediation are:
   - Child Custody
   - Child Support
   - Permanent Alimony
   - Distribution of Assets
3. Know your rights and obligations. Participate in the mediation process to understand both parties' perspectives.
4. Set your financial goals for the mediation settlement.
5. Control your emotions; avoid hurtful words that could hamper the process.
6. Be prepared to negotiate, avoid arguing, and aim for resolution.
7. Avoid making open offers at the start of mediation.
8. Keep the focus on child custody and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
9. Involve a lawyer in the mediation process to help with negotiation and drafting settlements to ensure terms are beneficial.

**Judicial Separation**

Judicial Separation falls under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Judicial separation refers to the termination of marital obligations by the court, where both husband and wife remain legally married but do not need to perform marital duties such as cohabitation. The purpose of Section 10 is to preserve the marriage bond. For example, if a husband and wife decide to separate due to misunderstandings, the court can grant a decree of judicial separation. If they later regret their decision and want to reconcile, they can cancel the decree.

After a decree of judicial separation and if the parties still wish to remain separated after a year, they can apply for a divorce under Section 13(1A)(i) based on the grounds of judicial separation. The court also has discretionary powers to grant a decree of judicial separation after a year under Section 13A of the Hindu Marriage Act.

Grounds where judicial separation cannot be passed:

- Conversion
- Renunciation (a valid ground for divorce)
- Presumed death

**Grounds for Divorce (Section 13(1))**

- Adultery
- Cruelty
- Desertion
- Conversion
- Unsoundness of Mind
- Venereal Disease
- Renunciation
- Presumed Dead

**Grounds for Divorce (Section 13(1A))**

- Non-resumption of Cohabitation
- No Restitution of Conjugal Rights



**Effects of Judicial Separation**

- Parties are not bound to live together or cohabit.
- Marriage is still legally bound.
- Parties can resume cohabitation if desired.
- If cohabitation isn't resumed for a year or more, it becomes grounds for divorce under Section 13(1A)(i).
- After judicial separation, forcing sexual intercourse can lead to legal consequences.

**Rescission of Judicial Separation Decree**

Parties wishing to cancel the decree of judicial separation can apply to the court under Section 10(2). The court will evaluate the application and, if satisfied, cancel the decree of judicial separation under Section 10(1).
