# Divorce and Female Vulnerability in Society

## Introduction

Divorce cases in India are governed by personal laws within the framework of the constitution that is rooted in secular principles. Despite various social and cultural progress and the adoption of Western influence, India remains a patriarchal society with rigid and narrow notions. Divorce is still considered a taboo or stigma in Indian society, where dowry and domestic violence are common. The traditional setup of the country has influenced the concept of marriage and marital life.

## Divorce

Indian society views marriage as irrevocable. A woman’s right to her husband’s social company and comfort is included under her right to personal liberty within Article 21 of the constitution. The three primary causes for divorce in Indian society are:

1. **Domestic Violence on Women**: Domestic violence has always been prevalent in Indian society. The Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown further aggravated this issue. Dowry is often cited as a major cause of domestic violence leading to divorce or marital breakdowns. Although the Dowry Prohibition Act 1985 penalizes giving and taking dowries, the system persists.

2. **Spouses Unable to Procreate Child**: Procreation is an essential element of marriage in Indian society. Religious and cultural beliefs emphasize the need for procreation. Women are often pressured to bear children and are discarded if found incapable.

3. **Mutual Consent**: In some cases, the decision to end the marriage is mutually decided by the parties. Despite the distinct causes for the breakup, mutual consent is often used for court proceedings.

## Grounds and Maintenance

Personal laws provide various grounds for divorce. Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act stipulates the reasons for divorce. The Divorce Act of 1869 provides provisions for the dissolution of marriage regardless of faith.

In Indian society, where men are primary earners, the entire family often depends on the male adult for essentials. Depending on the economic status of the woman, she can file a suit for maintenance. The court considers factors such as custody of the child and the husband’s financial situation before permitting the application.

## Remedies for Women

Personal laws that evolved from various religious beliefs and customs often oppose divorce or the ending of a marriage. As a result, courts try to resolve differences through various ADR procedures before finally granting a divorce.

In most Indian households, violence is a primary outcome of dowry disputes. Despite laws enacted to prohibit dowry, the rigid Indian culture and negligence of enforcement agents have led to unchanged violence rates. The judicial system's lengthy process to deliver justice causes distress and torture for women in marital homes.

## Impact of Divorce

Marital disruption results in serious economic problems for women in India, especially those with children. Most separated, divorced, or deserted women live at a bare subsistence level and struggle to provide essentials for themselves and their children. Custody principles often pose difficulties for unemployed women with poor economic conditions. Women often depend on their divorced partners for maintenance, and when husbands fail to make regular payments or alimony, women suffer economically. Many women forgo child support to avoid contact with abusive ex-husbands or because they fear the fathers will seek custody of the children. Thus, divorce has a negative impact on family life.

The economic cost of divorce often falls more heavily on women. After separation, women often experience a sharper decline in household income and greater poverty risk. The four risk factors faced by women as a result of divorce are:

1. Higher economic need and restricted earning capacities with children.
2. Insufficient child maintenance.
3. Disproportionate loss of income.
4. Human capital defects resulting from gender specialization.

Since women are generally more dependent on their partners, they are at higher risk of losing housing security after divorce. Women are more likely to lose home ownership. The lack of readily available public assistance for divorced women further exacerbates the problem. While most developed countries provide financial assistance to divorced women, public assistance is not readily available in Indian society.

## Conclusion

Unlike in Western countries, women in India are often hesitant to seek divorce despite their circumstances. A primary reason is their dependence on husbands for essentials and survival. The traditional concept of men as primary providers and women as caretakers is still prevalent in Indian society. Women courageous enough to seek divorce to escape harsh circumstances do not receive public assistance or sufficient family support.

Divorced women are more vulnerable due to the stigma they face and their dependence on male partners. Despite receiving custody of the child naturally by the court, partners often fail to provide maintenance, worsening the conditions for women heavily dependent on maintenance payments from their partners.
