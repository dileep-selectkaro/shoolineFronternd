# The Effectiveness of the Narcotics Control Bureau in Curbing Drug Abuse in India

## Introduction

The control over narcotic drugs was initially managed under **The Opium Act, 1852**, **The Opium Act, 1878**, and **The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930**. These acts were found inadequate due to the rise in illicit drug traffic and drug abuse both nationally and internationally. To consolidate and amend these laws, the **Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Bill** was introduced in Parliament, leading to the enactment of the **Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS Act)** on 16th September 1985. Consequently, the **Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)** was established in March 1986 under Section 4(3) of the NDPS Act. The NDPS Act was amended in May 1989 to include controls over precursor chemicals, and the Bureau was tasked with their implementation.

## Role of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)

As per the notification dated 17-3-1986, the NCB’s responsibilities include:

- **Coordination** of actions by various officers, State Governments, and other authorities under the principal Act, the Customs Act, 1962, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and other relevant laws.
- **Implementation** of counter-measures against illicit traffic under international conventions.
- **Assistance** to foreign authorities and international organizations for the prevention and suppression of illicit drug traffic.
- **Coordination** with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Welfare, and other concerned ministries regarding drug abuse matters.

## Functions of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)

The NCB focuses on:

- **Fighting drug trafficking** on an All India level, cooperating with Customs, Central Excise/GST, State Police, CBI, and other intelligence agencies.
- **Providing resources and training** to drug law enforcement personnel.
- **Monitoring drug smuggling** activities.
- **Implementing international obligations** related to countermeasures against illicit drug traffic.
- **Assisting international authorities** to facilitate coordinated actions globally.
- **Coordinating with concerned ministries and departments** on drug abuse matters.

### Primary Counter Narcotics Focus Areas in India

- Surveillance and enforcement at import points and borders.
- Preventive efforts along known drug routes.
- Control measures at export points, such as terminals and post offices.
- Improved coordination among drug law enforcement agencies.
- Identification and eradication of illicit cannabis and opium cultivation.
- Strengthening intelligence capabilities for better operational intelligence.
- Increased international cooperation in operational intelligence, investigations, and legal assistance.

## Statistics

The NCB's current concern is the increase in substance and drug abuse, particularly over-the-counter medicines. In 2020, the NCB registered 46 cases, seizing various drugs, including mephedrone, methamphetamine, and cocaine. The largest drug haul in May 2020 involved 1,818 kg of pseudoephedrine and 2 kg of cocaine, valued at around Rs 1,000 crore. The NCB tracked 142 operational drug syndicates, with a heroin trade estimated at Rs 140,000 crore and 2 million heroin addicts. They estimated that 360 metric tonnes of retail-quality heroin and 36 MT of wholesale-quality heroin are smuggled into India annually. The NCB has also arrested India’s first darknet narcotics operative.
