# Distinction Between Fast Track Courts (FTC) and Regular Courts
### By Vaishnavi Kakumani

## FAST TRACK SPECIAL COURTS:
The right to a speedy trial is the essence of criminal justice, and it is widely recognized that justice delayed is justice denied. The Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) were established with the aim to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases, implementing the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, and complying with the directives of the Supreme Court. The Scheme for FTSCs, including exclusive POCSO Courts nationwide, was launched on October 2, 2019. These courts aim to expedite the disposal of cases, particularly those involving serious offenses, to ensure timely justice.

The FTSC Scheme saw initial launch for one year from October 2, 2019, with subsequent extensions, the latest being until March 31, 2026, emphasizing the government's commitment to providing time-bound justice. Fast track courts are characterized by procedural expediency, caseload management focusing on specific offenses, and a set time frame for case disposal, among other features aimed at streamlining the judicial process.

### Pros:
- Procedural Expediency: Streamlined procedures and swift resolution.
- Caseload Management: Focus on specific types of cases to reduce backlog.
- Time Frame: Disposal of cases within a shorter timeframe.
- Deterrent Effect: Swift justice may discourage criminal activities.

### Cons:
- Temporary Nature: No creation of permanent infrastructure/asset.
- Limited Scope and Jurisdiction: Exclusively handles certain types of cases.
- Selection of Cases: Challenges in deciding which cases to prioritize.
- Dependence on Resources: Requires adequate resources and infrastructure for effectiveness.
- Risk of Miscarriage of Justice: Fast-tracking could compromise thorough examination of evidence.
- Lack of Accountability: Accelerated pace may reduce scrutiny of judicial decisions.

## REGULAR COURTS:
Regular courts, or district courts, are the primary adjudicating bodies for a wide range of legal matters at the district level. They follow standard legal procedures, handling civil, criminal, and administrative cases. Despite their crucial role in upholding the rule of law, regular courts often face challenges such as prolonged case durations and a high backlog of cases, leading to delays in justice delivery.

### Pros:
- Thorough Examination: Adherence to established legal procedures ensures comprehensive evidence review.
- Comprehensive Review: Allows for the consideration of complex legal issues.
- Experienced Judges: Presided over by judges with deep legal understanding.
- Guardians of Rights: Protect individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.

### Cons:
- Prolonged Duration: Cases may take years to reach a judgment.
- High Backlog: Overwhelmed court system leads to inefficiencies.
- Resource Constraints: Inadequate infrastructure and shortage of judges.
- Financial Burden: Legal proceedings can be costly, deterring access to justice.

## Conclusion:
In India, the judiciary operates both regular courts and fast track courts, each serving specific functions within the legal system. Fast Track Special Courts aim to provide expedited justice, especially in cases requiring urgent attention, while regular courts ensure the thorough and comprehensive adjudication of a wide range of legal matters. Balancing the benefits of speed with the need for careful legal consideration remains a challenge, underscoring the importance of continued efforts to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of the justice delivery system.
