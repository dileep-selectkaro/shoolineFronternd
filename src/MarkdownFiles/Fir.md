**FIR**


**What is an FIR?**

The First Information Report (FIR) is a written document prepared by a police officer, containing information about the commission of a criminal offense, e.g.- murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, etc. The FIR is the primary and most important step in seeking justice against any criminal offense.

**Who can file an FIR?**
An FIR can be filed by the victim of the offense that is to be reported, or any person on behalf of the victim if he/she is either dead or not in a state to make the complaint. A person who has witnessed the crime taking place can also file a legal complaint or any other person who has knowledge about the commission of an offense.
 
**Where can you file an FIR?**

An FIR can only be made for cognizable crimes i.e., serious offenses involving 3 or more years of punishment under the Indian Penal Code 1860 (rape, murder, theft). In case of non-cognizable offenses (that carry a punishment of less than 3 years), the police will read the matter and direct it to the magistrate. Generally, the FIR should be filed at a police station that is nearest to your place of residence or the place where the crime has taken place. However, if you have any confusion regarding the jurisdiction of the police station in which the FIR should be filed, you can even file a zero FIR in any police station. The police officer shall later transfer the case to the police station having competent jurisdiction in the case.


 
**Important things to keep in mind while filing an FIR**

1. The FIR should be filed soon after the occurrence of the incident that has to be reported. Any delay in filing the same shall have to be also specified in the report.
2. You must ensure that the police officer has taken down the report in writing if it has been narrated by you orally.
3. You must also ensure that the FIR is recorded in a language that can be understood by you.
4. You must specify all the relevant information you have, related to the crime that is being reported. Here, it becomes really difficult for a common man to understand what information is considered relevant information in the eyes of law. Following are a few of the details that you should necessarily mention in your FIR.

 **Who is the perpetrator of the crime?**

- Who has the crime been committed against â€“ victim /complainant?
- When was it committed (time)?
- Where was it committed (specific place /locality/area)?
- Why do you think it was committed?
- Which way (the actual process involved) was it committed?
- Were there any witnesses? (Names will be required here.)
- What were the losses? (Money /valuables/ physical damage, etc)
- Also if you have any evidence related to the crime
5. Ensure that the arrival/departure time is mentioned in the F.I.R and the Daily Diary (DD) Register at the Police Station.
6. After the FIR has been recorded, carefully read the same and then sign it.
7. You must also ensure that the FIR has been recorded by the officer in the book that has to be maintained by him for this purpose by the State Government. 

Remedies are available in case the police officer denies to register the FIR 
You can directly meet the Superintendent of Police or any other official concerned and bring your complaint to their notice.



You can send your complaint in writing through a post to the Superintendent of Police concerned. If the officer is satisfied with your complaint, he shall either investigate the case himself or order an investigation to be made.

You can file a private complaint before the court having jurisdiction.

If the police do nothing to enforce the law or if they act in a biased or corrupt manner, then you can always approach the State Human Rights Commission or the National Human Rights Commission.

**When can you file an e-FIR?**

An e-FIR or an online complaint can only be made against non-cognizable criminal offenses, which means the offenses while carrying less than three years of punishment to the offender as provided under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Some of the non-cognizable offenses are- assault, cheating, assault, etc. E-FIR is a process wherein an individual can go online and log into the specified website and file an FIR. In turn, he receives a confirmation receipt with the date, along with a specific FIR number. The complainant will have to log on to the portal and create a user ID and submit some personal information before proceeding to file the complaint. The complainant will subsequently have to visit the police station concerned, along with the E-FIR reference number, to complete the remaining procedural formalities before the police can proceed with further investigation.

**Why do you need a Lawyer?**

An experienced attorney can give you expert advice on how to handle your criminal legal problem owing to his/her years of experience in handling such criminal cases. A criminal lawyer is an expert on the laws and can help you avoid significant mistakes that may cause further harm or will require future legal proceedings to correct. Thus, by hiring an attorney you can ensure avoid delay and can seek justice quickly. A good criminal lawyer will guide you in the right direction, depending upon the facts and circumstances of your case. Even if the FIR is against you, or if you need bail or need to be represented in front of the Court, it is a must that you hire a criminal advocate.

**Section 482 CrPc - Quashing Of FIR:**

 Guidelines set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
On 4th October 2017 the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Parbatbhai Aahir & Ors. Vs. State of Gujarat & Anr. (Criminal Appeal No. 1723 of 2017) set out guidelines to be followed by courts in exercise of its inherent power under S 482 of Crpc . The Hon'ble Supreme Court summarized the propositions after careful observations of various precedents on this subject.
Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;

The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First Information Report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable.

In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;

While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised:

to secure the ends of justice or
to prevent an abuse of the process of any court;


The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should be quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulated;

In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences;

As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing in so far as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;

Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;

In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a 17 conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and

There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions (viii) and (ix) above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the state have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the balance.

**Conclusion**


The Hon'ble Supreme Court has set out the above principles to prevent an abuse of the process of courts or to secure the ends of justice and therefore one should approach the High Courts only with clean hands so as to enable the High Courts to prevent an abuse of process of court and to prevent gross miscarriage of justice.
