# Validity of Divorce Decree Passed by a Foreign Court in India
### By Vaishnavi Kakumani

The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides a mechanism to enforce certain types of foreign decrees and judgments passed by superior courts of notified reciprocal foreign countries, as if such decree(s) were passed by an Indian court. This direct enforcement mechanism under the CPC recognizes the principles of res judicata if such matter is determined on merits between the parties before a foreign court, subject to compliance with certain conditions.

Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is essential when it comes to enforcement and validity of foreign decrees in India, the section reads as under:

**When foreign judgment not conclusive —A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except—**

(a) where it has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction;  
(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;          
(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognize the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;      
(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;       
(e) where it has been obtained by fraud; and              
(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.

Hence, to be deemed of a binding character, the judgment will need to pass through the 6 tests mentioned as exceptions. A Foreign divorce decree shall be considered to be valid and conclusive in the following case that if one of the partners contests divorce filed in Foreign Land it would be said that he/she consented to the jurisdiction of that Court, in such a case the decree would be considered to be a conclusive one.

### PARTICIPATION OF RESPONDENT:

When an ex-parte decree is passed by a Foreign Court, it would not be valid and conclusive in India. A decree would be considered ex-parte if summons are not served on the opposite party. However, if such decree was deliberately left to go ex-parte i.e., no summons are served on the opposite party then the Indian Courts would not allow this fraud.

**Did not attend nor actively participated:** The non-applicant always has an option not to attend nor actively participate in the foreign court proceedings. This would be taken as, the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. This, however, does not mean that the non-applicant is not even required to be served in the foreign court proceedings. Non-service would amount to denial of opportunity to be heard. As the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction, it is further said that this non-applicant did not chance a judgment in his/her favor. Challenge to the foreign court decree in such a situation may be entertained by the Indian courts. It cannot, therefore, be said that having participated, having submitted to the jurisdiction, and having made submissions before the foreign court, now because the verdict of the foreign court is against the non-applicant, he is now challenging the same in the Indian court. The non-applicant must be served with notice of the foreign court proceedings. Or else, the proceedings would be taken in law to be a nullity i.e., of no value in law. If this is a situation, Indian courts are likely to declare the entire foreign court proceedings as void.

**Divorce is obtained on grounds other than the grounds enumerated under the Hindu Marriage Act if the parties were married under Hindu Law,** as a divorce matter is governed by the law under which one gets married and not the law of the land where the party is residing.

### RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN DECREES:

The Indian Legal System categorizes foreign judgments and awards from all the quarters of the world into two groups, Viz.

(a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and  
(b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.

### ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS FROM NON-RECIPROCATING TERRITORIES OF INDIA:

In this case, the process is more complicated since a suit needs to be filed before the Indian Court as well. The decree cannot be executed directly. The Court in India has to deem the foreign decree enforceable and pass its own decree upholding the foreign decree. It has to be proven before the Indian Court that the tests laid down under Section 13 of the CPC are satisfied. Judgments from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ only have evidentiary and persuasive value in the eyes of Indian Judiciary and must be filed for enforcement within three years from the day when they were originally passed. No doubt, Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of the Indian Judiciary, but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of "the cause of Justice" upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.

In *Marine Geotechnics LLC v. Coastal Marine Construction & Engineering Ltd.*, the Bombay High Court observed that in the case of a decree from a non-reciprocating foreign territory, the decree-holder should file, in a domestic Indian court of competent jurisdiction, a suit on that foreign decree or on the original, underlying cause of action, or both.

### EXECUTION OF FOREIGN DECREE FROM A FOREIGN COURT

Under Indian law, there are two ways of getting a foreign judgment enforced:

First, by filing an execution under Section 44A of the Civil Procedure Code. It states that a decree passed by Courts in reciprocating territories can be executed in India as if the decree was passed by the Indian Courts only. Decree from Courts in "reciprocating territories" can be enforced directly by filing before an Indian Court an Execution Decree.

Secondly, by filing a suit upon the foreign judgment/decree. For instance, the decree does not pertain to a reciprocating territory or a superior Court of a reciprocating territory, as notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette, the decree is not directly executable in India. Here the decree passed by the foreign court shall be considered as another piece of evidence. Judgments from "non-reciprocating territories" can be enforced only by filing a lawsuit in an Indian Court for a Judgment based on the foreign judgment. The foreign judgment is considered evidentiary. The time limit to file such a lawsuit in India is within three years of the foreign judgment.

### LANDMARK CASE LAWS:

*Veena Kalia Vs. Jatinder N. Kalia*, Ex-parte divorce decree was obtained in Canada on the grounds which was not available to the petitioner in India, the Delhi High Court held that such divorce was not valid and there is no res judicata on the judgment as such judgment was a nullity in Indian law.

The provisions of Section 13 of CPC were considered in detail by the Supreme Court of India in *Y. Narasimha Rao v. Y. Venkata Lakshmi*. This Court ruled that a court of competent jurisdiction would be the one which the law under which parties are married, recognizes. Any other court would be a court without jurisdiction, unless both parties voluntarily and unconditionally subject themselves to the jurisdiction of that Court.
