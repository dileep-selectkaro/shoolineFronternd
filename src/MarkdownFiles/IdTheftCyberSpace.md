# Identity Theft in Cyber Space
### By Vaishnavi Kakumani

Cybercrimes are rising rapidly with the evolution of technology and the internet. Defined as a criminal activity taking place on or over the medium of computers, the internet, or other technology recognized by the Information Technology Act, cybercrimes are the most devastating and prevalent crimes in the post-internet, modern era. According to the Oxford Dictionary, identity theft is defined as using somebody else's name and personal information in order to obtain credit cards and other goods or to take money out of the person's bank accounts. Identity theft is a sort of fraud that entails the unauthorized use of another person’s personal information to carry out unlawful acts or to get financial or other rewards. Name, address, Aadhar card number, PAN card, credit card numbers, and other private information about the victim are some examples of this data.

Identity thieves can use personal information to open credit card accounts, obtain loans, make purchases, or even submit a job application in the victim’s name. The victim’s information might also be used to access private financial accounts or apply for government benefits. Financial losses, damaged credit, and emotional anguish can all be significant and long-lasting effects of identity theft. Identity theft is not a new phenomenon; it has been a part of our society ever since the Internet and computers have come into existence.

### SANCTIONS UNDER THE IT ACT AND IPC:

An identity theft is a crime that involves committing both fraud and theft, therefore the provisions provided under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) is often invoked along with the Information Technology Act, 2000. The Information Technology Act (IT Act), a piece of legislation adopted in India, makes no mention of preventing identity theft in particular. The Act does, however, include provisions for the punishment of a number of cybercrimes, such as hacking and illegal access to private data.

A person can be held accountable for damages and compensation under sections 43 and 66 of the IT Act if they willfully and unlawfully access, download, copy, or extract any data or information from a computer resource. Furthermore, the IT Act’s section 72 addresses the protection of personal data and addresses the problem of data security. While the IT Act does not specifically address identity theft, it provides legal provisions for the punishment of unauthorized access to sensitive information and personal data protection.

Some of the Sections of the Indian Penal Code such as Forgery–sec. 464, Making False Documents- sec. 465, Forgery for Purpose of Cheating-sec. 468, Reputation-section 469, using as Genuine a Forged Document-sec. 471, and possession of a document known to be Forged and intending to use it as Genuine-sec. 474 can be coupled with those in the Information Technology Act. The Government has made certain recommendations to include 2 new sections into the IPC (Indian Penal Code), Section 147A and 419A.

### RECENT ANALYSIS OF TYPES OF IDENTITY THEFT IN CYBERSPACE:

In the present age of globalization and the online world, our electronic gadgets collect a great deal of data on each individual and store it deep on the hard drive. Sensitive information is stored in files such as cache, browser history, and other interim internet files. A hacker can get unauthorized access to data and share it with others, or even install harmful software on a computer or electronic device to extract sensitive and secret information, using such sensitive information. In our digital age, identity theft is a major issue that affects everyone. It's a huge crime that's fast-spreading and wreaking havoc on customers, well-known institutions, retail shops, and the economy as a whole. Since electronic identity fraud has taken on new dimensions, the truth is more ambiguous.

In 2022, the southern state of Karnataka in India had the highest number of registered offenses related to online identity theft, with more than 3.7 thousand cases registered with the authorities. The country recorded over five thousand cases of online identity theft that year. This category of crime came under the purview of Section 66C of the Indian Penal Code. India, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, is among the top ten countries in Asia-Pacific most affected by identity fraud that is committed using deepfake technology, according to a leading digital identity verification firm. The UK-based Sumsub Identity Fraud Report says 2023 recorded a significant rise in such cybercrimes, which will increase further next year. The cryptocurrency sector is particularly susceptible to deepfake fraud, accounting for 88 percent of incidents in 2023, with fintech following at eight percent. Other prevalent fraud techniques in 2023 include money muling, fake IDs, account takeovers, and forced verification, the last of which saw a 305 percent increase since 2022.

Unified Payment Interface (UPI) frauds are the most prevalent online financial frauds reported between January 2020 and June 2023, according to a report by IIT-Kanpur-incubated start-up, Future Crime Research Foundation (FCRF). The report, titled ‘A Deep Dive into Cybercrime Trends Impacting India’, shows that during this period, almost half (47.25 percent) of the cybercrimes reported were UPI-related.

### CASES OF FREEZING BANK ACCOUNTS OF SUSPECTED INDIVIDUALS:

**1) Mr Prakash Padukone vs State Of Karnataka:**  
Petitioner came in contact with a sports journalist who advised investing in a commodities exchange firm, leading to successful returns initially. Later, the petitioner's bank account was frozen under suspicion related to the investments. The court held that freezing the account without strong suspicion adversely affects the petitioner's right to life, directing the unfreezing of the account upon submitting a bond.

**2) Narayan Yadav v. State of Karnataka:**  
The complainant was deceived into transferring money based on a fraudulent lottery win email, leading to the freezing of the petitioner's bank accounts linked to the incident. The court recognized the adverse effect on the petitioner's life due to account freezing, directing defreezing upon providing a bank guarantee for the disputed amount and compliance with investigation requirements.

**3) Smt Neeta Shanthilal vs State Of Karnataka:**  
The petitioner, implicated in a credit card fraud case indirectly through her husband's arrest, faced freezing of her business accounts. The court ruled the freezing unjust, given the lack of direct evidence linking the petitioner to the fraud, and ordered the accounts to be defrozen, emphasizing the importance of not penalizing individuals without concrete evidence of wrongdoing.

**4) Mr Nirmalbhai Ambalal Patel vs State Of Karnataka:**  
Similar to the Padukone case, this petition involved the freezing of bank accounts due to suspected fraudulent activities. The court, following precedent, granted relief by ordering the defreezing of accounts, contingent on compliance with specific legal stipulations.

**5) Sri Sathish M C vs State Of Karnataka:**  
This case further emphasizes the judiciary's stance on the rights of individuals against whom accounts are frozen without sufficient justification. The court's decision to defreeze accounts, underlining the principle of fairness and the necessity for concrete evidence before taking such drastic measures.

Identity theft in cyber space represents a growing concern, requiring vigilant legal frameworks and protective measures for individuals' rights and financial security. These cases highlight the delicate balance between law enforcement's need to prevent fraud and protect individuals from unjust punitive measures without substantial evidence.
