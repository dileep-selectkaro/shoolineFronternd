# Identity Theft in Cyber Space

**By Vaishnavi Kakumani**

Cybercrimes are rising rapidly with the evolution of technology and the internet. Defined as a criminal activity taking place on or over the medium of computers, the internet, or other technology recognised by the Information Technology Act, cybercrimes are the most devastating and prevalent crimes in the post-internet, modern era.

According to Oxford Dictionary, identity theft is defined as using somebody else’s name and personal information in order to obtain credit cards and other goods or to take money out of the person’s bank accounts.

Identity theft is a sort of fraud that entails the unauthorised use of another person’s personal information to carry out unlawful acts or to get financial or other rewards. Name, address, Aadhar card number, PAN card, credit card numbers, and other private information about the victim are some examples of this data.

Identity thieves can use personal information to open credit card accounts, obtain loans, make purchases, or even submit a job application in the victim’s name. The victim’s information might also be used to access private financial accounts or apply for government benefits. Financial losses, damaged credit, and emotional anguish can all be significant and long-lasting effects of identity theft. Identity theft is not a new phenomenon; it has been a part of our society ever since Internet and computers have come into existence.

## SANCTIONS UNDER THE IT ACT AND IPC

An identity theft is a crime that involves committing of both fraud and theft, therefore the provisions with provided under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) is often invoked along with the Information Technology Act, 2000.

The Information Technology Act (IT Act), a piece of legislation adopted in India, makes no mention of preventing identity theft in particular. The Act does, however, include provisions for the punishment of a number of cybercrimes, such as hacking and illegal access to private data. A person can be held accountable for damages and compensation under sections 43 and 66 of the IT Act if they willfully and unlawfully access, download, copy, or extract any data or information from a computer resource. Furthermore, the IT Act’s section 72 addresses the protection of personal data and addresses the problem of data security.

While the IT Act does not specifically address identity theft, it provides legal provisions for the punishment of unauthorized access to sensitive information and personal data protection. Some of the Sections of Indian Penal Code such as Forgery–sec. 464, Making False Documents-sec. 465, Forgery for Purpose of Cheating-sec. 468, Reputation-section 469, using as Genuine a Forged Document-sec. 471 and possession of a document known to be Forged and intending to use it as Genuine-sec. 474 can be coupled with those in the Information Technology Act. The Government has made certain recommendations to include 2 new sections into the IPC (Indian Penal Code), Section 147A and 419A.
