# Judgement, Decree, and Order

## Decree

Section 2(2) of the CPC defines a decree as a formal expression of an adjudication expressed by the Court conclusively determining the preliminary or final rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in a controversy in the suit. A decree can be of preliminary, final, partly preliminary, or partly final in nature. A decree can include the rejection of a plaint or determination of a question with Section 144 but shall not include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order or any order of dismissal by default.

### Essential Elements

1. **Formal Expression**: A decree should be a formal expression of adjudication. The court must formally express its decision in the manner provided by law. Since the decree follows a judgement, it must be drawn up separately. If the decree is not drawn up formally, there is absolutely no scope for an appeal against the judgement.

2. **Adjudication**: It is the judicial determination of the matter in a dispute. Therefore, an administrative decision cannot be seen as a decree. The adjudication can be about all or any of the matters in controversy in a suit. The matter of controversy shall be resolved by the court through the application of facts and circumstances of the case. The Supreme Court in *Madan Naik v. Hansubala Devi* held that if a matter is not judicially determined, then it is not a decree. In *Deep Chand v. Land Acquisition Officer*, the apex court held that adjudication should be made by the officer of the Court; in the absence of which it shall not be recognized as a decree.

3. **Suit**: Adjudication must be given in a suit, and a suit can be commenced by filing a plaint in a civil court. Without a civil suit, a decree cannot be present. However, certain provisions allow applications to be treated as suits, such as proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, Indian Succession Act, Land Acquisition Act, etc. These suits are of statutory nature and the decisions given under them are considered as decrees.

4. **Rights of the Parties**: Rights include both substantive and procedural rights. The parties to the rights in controversy should be plaintiffs and defendants. An order passed upon the application filed by a third party who is a stranger to a suit is not a decree. Similarly, an order rejecting the application filed by a plaintiff to waive the court cost is not a decree as it does not determine the right of the party with regards to the matters alleged in a suit.

5. **Conclusive Determination**: The decision passed by the court will be complete and final; arguments to change the decision will not be entertained by the court. An interlocutory order which does not determine the final rights of the parties is not considered a decree.

### Types

1. **Preliminary Decree**: A decree wherein the adjudication decides the rights of parties regarding the matters of dispute but does not dispose of the suit completely. Preliminary decrees are passed when the court is compelled to adjudicate upon a certain matter before adjudicating the complete dispute. In *Mool Chand v. Director*, the court held that a preliminary decree is only a stage to work out the rights of parties until the matter is finally decided by the court.

2. **Final Decree**: A decree that disposes of the suit completely is recognized as final. It settles all the issues between the parties to a suit by a court of law.

3. **Partly Preliminary and Partly Final Decree**: A decree is held partly preliminary and partly final when certain disputes are determined, and the rest are open for further decision.

### Amendments

Clerical errors in the decrees can be changed and corrected by the court upon application under Section 152 of CPC. The errors should be a case of accidental omission or clerical error and not an error that would result in gross negligence.
