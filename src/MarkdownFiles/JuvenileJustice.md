# Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015

## Introduction

The JJ Act of 2015 was introduced to consolidate and amend the law relating to children in need of care and protection by catering to their basic needs and adopting child-friendly approaches in adjudication, protecting children’s interests, and providing rehabilitation through institutions and bodies established for the purpose.

## Defining ‘Juvenile’ - Nirbhaya’s Case

The Delhi gang rape case, a brutal and heinous crime, saw the accused imposed with death penalty except for a juvenile who was 17 at the time of the crime. The juvenile was released after three years of conviction and exempted from the death penalty as protected under J.J.A 2000. This case led the Parliament to amend the existing JJA of 2000. The new act lowered the age of criminal responsibility in exceptional cases. The JJA 2015 defines a juvenile as a child below the age of 18 years. The new act allows children between the ages of 16-18 alleged to have committed heinous offences to be tried and sentenced as adults. Children in conflict with the law will be assessed by the Juvenile Justice Board, and children in need of care and protection will be taken care of by the Child Welfare Committee.

## Juvenile Justice Board

The State Government shall constitute one or more Juvenile Justice Boards for every district to exercise powers and discharge functions related to children in conflict with the law. The board shall consist of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate and two social workers, one of whom shall be a woman. The powers conferred to the Bench are prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. The State Government should ensure the sensitisation, induction, and training of all members in the Board within sixty days from the date of appointment. Appointment of members, except the Principal Magistrate, can be terminated after inquiry by the State Government. The Board shall observe rules regarding the transaction of business and ensure that all procedures are child-friendly. A high-level committee will review the number of cases pending and their duration, nature, and reasons every six months.

## Children in Conflict with Law

A child alleged to be in conflict with the law shall be placed under the charge of a special juvenile police unit or the designated child welfare police officer, who shall produce the child before the board within 24 hours of apprehending the child. The designated officer or unit shall have full responsibility for the child and their maintenance during the period stated by the board. A child alleged to have committed a bailable or non-bailable offence, detained by the police or brought before the Board, shall be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or any other person deemed fit unless such release would expose the person to danger. If not released, the Board shall send the child to an observation home during the period of inquiry. Once a child is apprehended, the officer in charge shall immediately inform the parent or guardian of the child and a probation officer for the preparation of a social investigation report. The inquiry period should be completed within four months unless extended for another two months. If a child above the age of 16 commits a heinous offence, the Board shall conduct a preliminary assessment regarding their mental and physical capacity, ability to understand consequences, and circumstances under which the offence was committed. Children found in conflict with the law are asked to participate in group counselling, perform community service, or are directed to a special home. The board may also pass orders allowing the child to attend school, vocational training centre, therapeutic centre, undergo de-addiction programmes, or prohibit the child from frequenting a particular place.

## Children’s Court

If, after preliminary assessment, the child needs a trial, the board may transfer the case to a Children’s Court, which decides the need for trial of the child as an adul
