No maximum or minimum amount of alimony has been set by law; hence, it is upon the parties to agree upon a particular sum.

While obtaining a divorce through mutual consent, the parties are required to settle the issue of child custody. Custody of the child implies as to who the child will physically reside with.

Both parents are equally competent to take custody of the children. However, in this kind of divorce, the parties need to mutually agree upon matters such as - who would have the physical custody of the child, the duration of visitation rights, the interim custody, and how the child’s living and educational costs will be met, etc. The spouse can even opt for joint custody. Under this arrangement, one of the parents would be the primary caretaker and thus have the physical custody of the child, and both would have legal custody of the child.

**Q: Is the Divorce law different for different religions in India?**

A: Yes, like marriage laws, divorce laws are also different for different religions. Divorce for Hindus is covered by Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This includes Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists. Christians are governed by Indian Divorce Act, 1869. Muslims are governed by the personal laws of divorce and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 1939 and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986. For inter-religion marriages, there is a secular law, the Special Marriage Act, of 1954. The following list explains mutual divorce in different religions: 
 
 1. Mutual Divorce under Muslim Law: Under Muslim Law, there are two categories of divorce - ‘judicial’ and extra-judicial. Mutual Divorce under Muslim Law falls under the extra-judicial category. There are two kinds of divorce by a mutual agreement called ‘khula’ and ‘Mubarat’. Under both these kinds of mutual divorce, the woman is to part with her ‘dower’ or some other property.  
‘Khula’ under Muslim Law is said to be an agreement between the husband and wife for dissolving a union in lieu of compensation (part of her property) that is paid by the wife to her husband. Even though this consideration is important, the actual delivery of property is not a precondition for the validity of the divorce under the ‘khula’ system. An irrevocable divorce takes place once the husband gives his consent, and the husband has no right to cancel the ‘khul’ on the ground of consideration not having been paid.  
Under the ‘mubarat’ form of mutual divorce, both the parties must desire a divorce, and thus the proposal for it can emanate from either wife or husband. Both these parties should be willing to separate. Once the offer is made, the other party must accept it, and once it is accepted, the divorce becomes irrevocable. Under the Sunnis, once the husband and wife enter a ‘mubarat’, all the rights and obligations of the parties come to an end. In Shias, a proper form is imposed, i.e., the word ‘mubarat’ should be followed by the word ‘talaq’ for the divorce to take place. These words should be uttered in Arabic, and the intention to end the marriage should be expressed clearly.  
In both ‘Khula’ and ‘Mubarat’, the wife shall go through the ‘iddat’ period and in both, a divorce is an act of the parties, and no intervention by the court is required.
 
2. Mutual Divorce under Christian Law: Divorce for Christians in India is provided for under the Divorce Act, 1869. Section 10 A of the Act gives the provision for dissolution of marriage by mutual consent. A petition for mutual divorce can be presented by both parties to the appropriate district court. The petition should be presented upon the grounds that the parties have been living separately for more than a year and that it is not possible for them to cohabit together and that the decision to dissolve the marriage has been mutually agreed upon.
This petition can be withdrawn after the expiry of 6 months from the date of the presentation of the petition but before a lapse of 18 months from this date.

**Q: What is MOU (Mediation Agreement) / Settlement Agreement for Mutual Divorce?**

A memorandum of Understanding or Settlement Agreement can be said to be the basis upon which the Husband and Wife take Divorce. An MOU is a mutual settlement that has been written down on paper and signed between the two parties. This MOU can act as documentary proof of terms accepted between the husband and wife at the time of Mutual Divorce. Since Mutual Divorce is a kind of Settlement, an MOU should be entered into between the parties to Mutual Divorce.

Terms regarding the following topics can be added as a part of the MOU: 
 
1.	The mutual understanding based on which both husband and wife are getting divorced,
2.	Settlement of maintenance and alimony issues- who pays to whom and how much,
3.	Child custody issues; with whom does the child stay, who has the visitation rights, whether it is joint custody or not, etc.
4.	Duties and Liabilities of the husband and wife towards children,
5.	Any other condition relating to properties, children, maintenance, separation, etc.

**Q: Why is it important to have an MOU in mutual divorce?**

 A: Since it is not a one-sided or contested divorce and the parties should settle alimony/maintenance and child custody matters mutually between them. 
Some reasons why an MOU should be created are stated below:

1.	It helps in ensuring that future litigations do not arise. However, the minutest details should be mentioned in the MOU.
2.	Clear terms are set out in writing for future references, which will lead to less confusion in the future,
3.	The rights, liabilities, assets and debts, and other claims of the parties are clearly demarcated in the MOU
4.	Claims of maintenance and alimony as mutually decided are clearly mentioned and the increase or decrease in such alimony/maintenance in probable future scenarios are also stated therein, thus, ensuring future complications do not arise.
5.	In case of breach of the terms mentioned, the parties can sue each other for breach of contract.
6.	Frivolous litigations for child custody cause extra burdens and hamper the well-being of the child. Thus, if terms regarding custody are mentioned clearly, the burden of future litigations is reduced to a huge extent.
7.	MOU may also safeguard the interest of the husband from false allegations of domestic violence and cases of Section 498A.
8.	Specific performance according to MoU can also be enforced by the aggrieved party if the other party has failed to perform the acts and liabilities mentioned in the MOU.


**Q: Can a wife claim maintenance after mutual consent divorce if the parties have agreed on a lump sum amount as a final settlement?**
 
A: Recently, the question of whether a wife can claim maintenance after the marriage has been dissolved by a divorce decree and the payment of a lump sum amount has been made to the wife in the form of a full and final settlement for maintenance came up before the Calcutta High Court. The legal issue here was what would be the procedure adopted if the marriage between the parties was dissolved and the wife received a lump sum amount as a one-time payment for maintenance. The matter, however, remains undecided because of the different views of the High court.
Therefore, in the absence of a well-settled law on the matter, it cannot be said whether a wife, who, after receiving a lump sum amount as final payment after mutual consent divorce, is entitled to maintenance.
