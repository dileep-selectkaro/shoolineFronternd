# Non-Joinder and Misjoinder of Parties to a Suit

## Essentials in the Authority of Joinder of Parties

- **Rule 10(2) of Order 1**: Provides broad authority over joining parties. The true test is whether the plaintiff's requested order could impair the intervener’s legal rights.
  - **Plaintiff's Discretion**: Generally, the court should not force the plaintiff to include someone against whom they have no desire to fight.
  - **Court's Authority**: If necessary, the court may involve a specific individual to resolve disputes effectively.

## Doctrine of Necessary and Proper Parties

- **Criteria (Kasturi v. Iyyamperumal)**:
  1. The party must be entitled to some relief regarding the subject matter.
  2. Their absence should prevent the issuance of an effective decree.
- **Purpose**: Include all parties necessary to grant effective relief. Additional issues should not be framed merely because a party’s claims relate to the subject matter (Ramesh Hirachand Kundanmal v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Bombay).

## Order 1 Rule 9: Natural Justice Principle

- **Audi Alteram Partem**: No order can be passed behind the back of someone who will be negatively affected (J.S. Yadav v. State of U.P.).
- **Implications**: Orders passed in violation of this principle are not binding.

## Case Example: Praveen Bhatia v. M. Ghosh

- **Insurance Company**: Not deemed a necessary party as no relief was claimed against it.
- **Doctor**: Found to be a necessary party due to medical negligence.

## Difference Between Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of Parties

### Non-Joinder of Parties

- **Definition**: Essential parties who are not impleaded, making an effective decree impossible.
- **Requirement**: Presence of proper parties is needed for court convenience. Non-joinder is irreversible, but the court may order joining an essential party.
- **Exception**: A suit cannot be dismissed for non-joinder unless the party is essential for an effective order (Order 1 Rule 9 CPC).

### Misjoinder of Parties

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Plaintiffs**: When plaintiffs’ alleged rights to relief do not stem from the same act or transaction (State of Punjab vs Nathu Ram).
  - **Defendants**: When defendants’ relief claims do not stem from the same act or transaction.

#### Misjoinder of Causes of Action

1. **Plaintiffs and Causes of Action**: Plaintiffs must be jointly interested in each cause of action.
2. **Defendants and Causes of Action**: Different causes of action should not be separately joined against each defendant.
3. **Claims Based on Multiple Causes of Action**: Must contain all claims related to each cause of action as stipulated in Order 2 of the CPC.
