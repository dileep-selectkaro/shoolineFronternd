# Writ Petition: A Detailed Overview

## Introduction

A writ petition is a formal written order issued by a judicial authority, commanding a person or entity to perform a specific act or to cease performing a specific action. Writs are legal documents issued by the court to direct actions or inactions. They encompass orders, warrants, directions, summons, etc., and are crucial in ensuring the enforcement and protection of rights.

The Indian Constitution, under Part III, provides fundamental rights essential for the intellectual and moral development of its citizens. To protect these rights, Articles 32 and 226 provide remedies for their enforcement. Article 32 allows citizens to approach the Supreme Court directly for the enforcement of fundamental rights, while Article 226 empowers High Courts to issue writs for other matters.
