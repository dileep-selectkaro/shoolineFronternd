# Procedure for Filing Trademark under Trademarks Act

**Submitted by – Anna Rose**

## Introduction

A trademark is a sign, design, phrase, or word that distinguishes the goods or services of one enterprise from those of others. It helps customers recognize a company’s products and services. Trademarks are protected by intellectual property rights. Registering a trademark helps a company identify its products and services and protects them from unfair competition. Trademark rights are private property rights that can be enforced by judicial orders. As India is a party to the Paris Convention and TRIPS Agreement, the Act complies with its principles.

## Trademarks Act 1999

The Trademarks Act 1999 was established to amend and consolidate laws relating to trademarks, provide for their registration, and better protect the trademarks of goods and services, preventing the use of fraudulent marks. It permits filing of multiclass applications and extends the period of registration of a trademark to 10 years. The Act came into effect in 2003. It unifies the Merchandise Marks Act 1889 and various regulations about trademarks found in the IPC 1860, CPC 1973, and the Sea Customs Act 1878.

## Procedure for Filing a Trademark

1. **Trademark Search**: Before filing, it is important to conduct a detailed search to determine if the trademark is unique or distinct and to check for any existing similar or identical trademarks. This search helps identify risks in the usage of the trademark.

2. **Filing an Application**: The application must be filed in Form TM-A either online through the IP India official website or by physically presenting it at the Trademark Registry Office. The application must be filed in a single class of goods and services or multiclass, including the fees for each class. It should include required documents and details of the trademark. If claiming prior use, a user affidavit and evidence must be filed.

3. **Examination of the Trademark Application**: After filing, a mandatory examination is conducted, and a report is issued by the Examiner based on the guidelines of the Trademarks Act 1999. The report may contain absolute, relative, or procedural objections. The report is issued within 30 days of registration. A reply must be filed within 30 days of receiving the report, addressing objections with arguments and evidence.

4. **Post Examination**: After filing the reply, the Examiner may schedule a hearing if objections are met or not addressed. Following the hearing, the Examiner may accept the mark and forward the application for publication or reject it if objections persist.

5. **Advertisement of the Trademark**: Once accepted, the trademark is advertised in the Trade Marks Journal for four months to allow the public to oppose the registration.

6. **Opposition from the General Public**: After publication, aggrieved parties can file a notice of opposition via Form TM-0 within four months. If opposed, a counter-statement application with evidence and a hearing order is required to register the trademark.

7. **Registration of the Trademark**: The final step is registration. If no opposition is filed within four months, the trademark is issued an auto-generated certificate within a week. Once registered, the trademark is valid for 10 years and must be renewed within the prescribed time.

## Conclusion

Trademarks are crucial intellectual property, including signs, words, colors, logos, or designs, often represented graphically. They help differentiate goods or services of one individual or company from another. To own a trademark, it must be registered. The Trademarks Act 1999 governs trademark registration in India. Following the procedure is essential for obtaining the legal protection a registered trademark provides.
