# Research on Advantages and Disadvantages of Seeking Divorce Within a Month of Marriage

## Subject Matter

Married couple seeking divorce within a month of marriage. Claims of domestic abuse.

## Hindu Marriage Act

1. **Section 13(1)**: Treats the petitioner with cruelty during the course of marriage. Cruelty is broadly defined as any conduct that would cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it is harmful or injurious to live with the respondent.
2. **Section 14**: No petition for divorce to be presented within one year of marriage, except in cases of exceptional hardship or depravity during the marriage period. Consent for divorce must not be obtained by misrepresentation or concealment of the case’s nature; otherwise, the divorce decree is nullified or void.

### What is Exceptional Hardship to the Petitioner?

In *Savanam Giridhar Reddy v Savanam Pavani*, the court held that "exceptional hardship" and "depravity" set a high bar for leaving the court. Relief can only be granted if the petitioner can prove that continuing the marriage would result in exceptional hardship or that the petitioner has behaved with such exceptional depravity that continuing the marriage would be extremely detrimental to the partner.

In *Sankalp Singh vs Prarthana Chandra*, the court held that Section 14 is a mandatory requirement for seeking divorce. Such a course of action is possible, especially because there will not be a waiver of the minimum six-month hiatus period between the first and second motions, with the additional condition under Section 13B (1) that even if the first motion is presented within the first year of marriage, the decree of divorce would only be granted once the period of one year has elapsed from the separation.

*Ms. Urvashi Sibal v. Govt of NCT-Delhi High Court* stated that waiving the one-year marriage period before separation is a necessary condition.

## Advantages of Seeking Divorce

1. **Maintenance and Expenses**: Section 24 entitles maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings for cases where the husband or wife has no independent income sufficient to support the proceedings.
2. **Alimony and Maintenance**: In cases of one-year marriages, alimony and maintenance are awarded to the financially dependent spouse. Factors such as earnings, standard of living, and party’s ability to support themselves determine the amount and duration of payments.
3. **Remarriage**: Section 15 of HMA allows a divorced person to remarry once the divorce decree is granted by the court. The period is defined based on the new or existing appeal against the decree. Unless an existing appeal against any party in the court of law has been dismissed, the right to remarry lawfully remains void.

## Disadvantages of Seeking Divorce

1. **Division of Property and Assets**: Asset allocation is done by the couple rather than the court. This may result in a disproportionate divide of property, especially if one spouse is unaware of their rights. More legal oversight is needed to ensure equal asset division.
2. **Mutual Consent Divorce**: One party may not vocalize their financial assets and income, disadvantaging the other party who may not receive a fair portion of assets.
3. **Contested Divorce**: There is a higher financial burden on the person filing the divorce due to lawyer fees, filing fees, etc.

## Conclusion

Under the Hindu Marriage Act, marriage is considered a sacrament rather than a contract. Divorce is often considered a choice of last resort. During divorce proceedings, the court often seeks relief measures to reconcile the parties rather than separate them. A petition for divorce can only be produced after one year of marriage, unless there is exceptional depravity or hardship. Since these terms are not defined, they can be interpreted by the court based on precedents and case circumstances.

While divorce has a negative societal perception and some disadvantages, seeking divorce can sometimes be a relief rather than a burden based on the parties’ circumstances.
