# Restitution of Conjugal Rights

## Overview

Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with restitution of conjugal rights. 

**"When either the husband or wife has without reasonable cause withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court for restitution of conjugal rights. The court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in the petition, and there being no legal ground for the application to not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights."**

The Moonshee Buzloor Raheem v. Shumsoonissa Begum (1867) became the first case wherein restitution of conjugal rights was introduced. It was held that when a wife without lawful reasons withdraws from the society of the husband, the husband may sue the wife for restitution of conjugal rights.

## Related Legal Provisions

- Section 32 and 33 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869
- Section 36 of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936
- Section 22 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954
- General laws of Muslims

## Criteria for Application

If there is a reasonable excuse for the withdrawal from society, the burden to prove the same lies upon the person who withdraws from the society. 

- In the case of **Sushila Bai v. Prem Narain Rai AIR 1964**, the court held that a husband leaving his wife in her father’s home and not maintaining connections with her thereafter would be considered as withdrawal from society. Hence, the decree of restitution can be enforced. 
- In the case of **R. Natrajan v. Sujatha Vasudevan C.M.A**, the wife’s decision to leave her husband’s society because she found it difficult to live with his aged parents does not constitute a reasonable excuse.

## Exceptions

Petitioners' requests for restitution of conjugal rights will be unsuccessful in cases of cruelty, adultery, and any other case of marital wrongdoing. 

- In **Mohammad Rustam Ali v. Husaini Begum**, the respondent wife claimed that she was being mistreated by her husband and did not want to return to living with him as she felt that she was risking her safety. This was deemed by the court as a viable defense against Section 9 of HMA.

## Constitutional Validity

The constitutional validity of Section 9 has been often challenged in the court.

- In **T. Sareetha v T Venkatasubbaiah**, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that the impugned section was unconstitutional. In this case, the respondent had been married at the age of 16 and they stopped living together immediately. Consequently, Venkata filed a petition under Sec 9 of HMA. The respondent contended that Sec 9 violated the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. 
- The Supreme Court in the case of **Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan** agreed with the Delhi High Court’s judgement in **Harvinder Kaur v. Harminder Singh** and upheld the constitutional validity of Sec 9, overruling the decision given by AP High Court. The court held that the provision exists to aid the prevention of the break-up of marriage.

## Implications

One of the important implications of Sec 9 is that it allows the aggrieved party to apply for maintenance under Sec 25 of HMA. Another implication is that it provides for a ground for divorce under Sec 13(1A) of HMA, on the condition that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights between the parties for a period of 1 year after passing a decree for the same. Under HMA, anything which acts as grounds for nullity, dissolution of marriage, or judicial separation is a defense against the petition of RCR.

- In **Seema vs Rakesh Kumar (2000)**, the Supreme Court held that under a claim of decree of restitution of conjugal rights, the petitioner
