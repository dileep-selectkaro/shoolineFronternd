# Right of Minorities to Establish Educational Institutions in India

## Introduction

Article 30(1) of the Constitution provides linguistic and religious minorities with fundamental rights to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Article 30(1A) of the Constitution states that in making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such that it would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under the clause. Article 30(2) states that the State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.

## Minority

The Constitution recognizes both linguistic and religious minorities. Article 29 of the Constitution states that any section of citizens inhabiting the territory of India or any part of the country having a different language or culture should have the right to conserve their language, script, or culture. In the State of Bombay v. Education Society, Bombay, the school admitted only those whose mother tongue was English. A person from the Gujarati community was denied admission based on his mother tongue. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, a writ was filed before the High Court. The Court held that discrimination based on spoken language, caste, or religion is not permitted under Article 29(2). Section 2, clause (c) of the National Commission of Minorities Act declares six communities as minorities: Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, and Parsis. Linguistic minorities are classes or groups of people whose mother tongue is different from that of the majority groups.

## Right to Administer

Article 30(1) gives minority institutions the right to administer, conduct, and manage the affairs of the institution. The four principles include:
- Right to choose the managing or governing body
- Right to choose teachers compatible with the aims of the institution
- Right to use its property and assets for the benefit of the institution
- Right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations and academic qualifications

The right is not absolute, as regulations are necessary for ensuring efficient and sound administration.

## Precedents

In D.A.V. College v. State of Punjab, the university ordered Punjabi as the only medium of instruction to be provided in affiliated colleges. The Court held that the right provided to minorities under Article 30 guarantees them the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. This also includes the right to give instructions in their language, and the University Circular was directly violating the rights to have instructions in Hindi, thus infringing Article 30(1). It was also observed that a particular minority is considered a linguistic minority when it has a distinct local language.

In St. Stephen’s College v. University of Delhi, a five-judge bench held that Article 29(2) applies to both students belonging to minority and majority communities. Article 30(1) applies only to religious and linguistic minorities. The court held that the right provided under Article 30(1) cannot be nullified on the basis that Article 29(2) applies to both minorities and majorities. A minority educational institution has the right to reserve up to 50% of seats for students belonging to its community. Treating students differently does not amount to a violation of Article 29(2) and Article 14 of the Constitution.

In Re Kerala Education Bill (1957), a case that dealt with the constitutional validity of the bill, the bill sought to regulate the administration of private educational institutions in the state. The Supreme Court in its decision held that Article 30 grants religious and linguistic minorities the right to run educational institutions. The government can control admission policies and academic programmes of the school but not its internal operations or administration.

In St. Xavier’s College v. State of Gujarat (1974), the court held that there is no fundamental right to affiliation, but to deny affiliation except upon certain terms amounts to surrender of the right to administration. When a minority institution applies for affiliation, it expresses its choice to participate in the system of general education. Affiliation is for regulating the educational character and content. Therefore, measures which regulate the course of study, qualifications, and appointment of teachers, etc., are all germane to the affiliation of a minority institution.

## Government Control

Government exercise of control over minority institutions is necessary to prevent the misuse and exploitation of rights provided under Articles 29 and 30 by the minority group. Control is also exercised to check the academic status and maintain the standards required in the institutions. The state has the authority to make directive policies and take actions for the welfare of the academic as well as non-academic staff of the organization. The state is also responsible for keeping an eye on these institutions for their effective management and proper functioning.

In certain cases, it was held that the Government cannot impose restrictions and cannot interfere in the functioning of the institutions as it would lead to the infringement of the rights of the minorities. In the case of TMA PAI v. State of Karnataka, the court held that if the minority institution is not supported by the government, the state does have the right to intervene or make policies or rules or regulations related to the administration of minority institutions.

## National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions

The commission was established in 2004 under the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004. It is a quasi-judicial body endowed with the powers of the Civil Court for the purpose of discharging its functions under the Act. The commission performs the adjudicatory, advisory, and recommendatory roles. The commission decides questions relating to the status of the Minority Educational Institutions. The commission also has the power to cancel the minority status of an educational institution granted by an Authority. The court in Sisters of St Joseph of Cluny v/s The State of West Bengal and Ors (2018) held that the commission has both original and appellate jurisdiction.

## Conclusion

In a diverse and multi-linguistic country like India, there are a large number of religious and linguistic minorities. The constitution of the country has established laws to protect the rights of these minorities and has granted them certain beneficial rights such as the Right to establish Educational Institutions. Moreover, a commission has been established to protect the interests of minorities in establishing educational institutions. Such rights create a level of security among the minority class people.
