# Safeguarding Victims: Laws Protecting Domestic Abuse Victims in India
### By Vaishnavi Kakumani for Shoolin Consultancy

The World Health Organization reports that the proportion of women who had ever experienced physical or sexual violence or both by an intimate partner ranged from 15% to 71%, with the majority between 29% and 62%. Domestic violence is a global issue reaching across national boundaries as well as socio-economic, cultural, racial, and class distinctions. This problem is not only widely dispersed geographically, but its incidence is also extensive, making it a typical and accepted behavior.

Domestic violence against women is an age-old phenomenon. Women were always considered weak, vulnerable, and in a position to be exploited. Violence has long been accepted as something that happens to women. Cultural mores, religious practices, economic, and political conditions may set the precedence for initiating and perpetuating domestic violence, but ultimately committing an act of violence is a choice that the individual makes out of a range of options. Domestic violence is widespread, deeply ingrained, and has serious impacts on women's health and well-being. Its continued existence is morally indefensible. Its cost to individuals, to health systems, and to society is enormous.

Domestic abuse is a pervasive issue worldwide, with India being no exception. The country has grappled with the challenge of protecting victims and addressing the root causes of domestic violence. Over the years, significant legislative measures have been enacted to safeguard victims and prosecute perpetrators.

Considering the patriarchal nature of society, the laws primarily address the concerns of the women as they remain the main victims. Concerns of husbands or male partners are unaddressed. Moreover, in line with traditionalist views, domestic abuse laws are centered around married relationships. Though a series of judgments have extended safeguards of domestic abuse laws to women partners in live-in relationships. But, here too, concerns of men or same-sex partners where a woman might be abusing her woman partner remain unaddressed since laws are built in a heteronormative framework.

#### WHAT IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE?

Domestic violence can be described as the power misused by one adult in a relationship to control another. It is the establishment of control and fear in a relationship through violence and other forms of abuse. This violence can take the form of physical assault, psychological abuse, social abuse, financial abuse, or sexual assault. The frequency of the violence can be on and off, occasional or chronic.

“Domestic violence is not simply an argument. It is a pattern of coercive control that one person exercises over another. Abusers use physical and sexual violence, threats, emotional insults, and economic deprivation as a way to dominate their victims and get their way”.

Section 3 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 says any act/conduct/omission/commission that harms or injures or has the potential to harm or injure will be considered ‘domestic violence’. It comprises of:

- (a) Threats to Life, Health & Safety etc., whether Physical or Mental, incorporating Sexual Abuse, Physical Abuse, Verbal and Emotional Abuse, and Economic Abuse, or
- (b) Harassment through any forms such as injuries, harms to the aggrieved person by coercing her or any other person related to any unlawful demand for dowry or other property or valuable security; or
- (c) Otherwise injuring or causing harm, through Mental or Physical means to the Aggrieved Person.

#### LEGISLATIONS PROTECTING VICTIMS FROM DOMESTIC ABUSE:

**Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Act, 2005**

Till the year 2005, remedies available to a victim of domestic violence in the civil courts (divorce) and criminal courts (vide Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code) were limited. There was no emergency relief available to the victim; the remedies that were available were linked to matrimonial proceedings; and the court proceedings were always protracted, during which period the victim was invariably at the mercy of the abuser. Domestic Violence Act 2005 is the first significant attempt in India to recognise domestic abuse as a punishable offence, to extend its provisions to those in live-in relationships, and to provide for emergency relief for the victims, in addition to legal recourse. It is the cornerstone of domestic violence law in India for the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, enacted in 2005. This legislation recognizes the diverse forms of abuse faced by women, including physical, sexual, emotional, verbal, and economic abuse. The PWDVA aims to provide a civil remedy, ensuring immediate relief and protection for victims. It provides security to women in a family from men in a family. The extent of the Act covers not only the protection of women who are married to men but also women who are in Live-in-relationship, just as family members including Grandmothers, Mothers, etc. A woman has the right to be liberated from any type of violence under this Act. Under this law, women can look for security against Domestic Violence, Financial Compensation, Right to live in their mutual house, and they can get maintenance from their abuser in case they are living separated. This law is to guarantee that women don’t get kicked out of their own house and can support themselves if they have been abused. It also ensures the protection of women from their abusers. Even a single act of commission or omission may constitute domestic violence — in other words, women do not have to suffer a prolonged period of abuse before taking recourse to the law.

**Section 498A of the IPC (Indian Penal Code)**
This is a Criminal Law, which applies to husbands or family members of husband who are merciless to women. Under Section 498A of the IPC, harassment for Dowry by the family members of the husband or by the husband is recognized as a Crime. This harassment can be of any type either Physical or Mental. Despite the fact that Marital Rape isn’t considered as a Crime in India, forced sex with one’s wife can be viewed as Cruelty under this Section. Section 498A has a vast scope. It also includes any and all intentional behaviours against a woman which force the woman to attempt suicide or risk to life or grave injury or risk to limb or overall health. Here, health incorporates the physical and mental health of the woman.
 
**Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961**
This is a Criminal Law that punishes the giving and taking of Dowry. The tradition of dowry itself is banned under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. According to this law, giving, taking, or even demanding dowry, they can be imprisoned for a half year (i.e., for 6 months) or they can be fined up to Five Thousand Rupees.

According to the statute like Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code about death due to dowry harassment. It says, "Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called 'dowry death', and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death." The minimum punishment in such dowry deaths is seven years that can be extended to life imprisonment.

Under Sections 313-316 of the Indian Penal Code, infanticide of a girl child has been declared punishable, and it implies terminating a woman’s pregnancy forcefully.

Other Sections for The legal action for domestic violence in India include the Indian Penal Code that deals with these issues, Section 305 and Section 306 pertaining to Abetment of Suicide and Section 340 and Section 349 of the Indian Penal Code, respectively. Wrongful restraint or wrongful confinement.

### DECIDED LANDMARK JUDGEMENTS:

Significant cases such as Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma, Lalita Toppo v. the State of Jharkhand, and Hiralal P. Harsora and Ors. have significantly shaped the legal framework around domestic violence in India, ensuring broader protections and clarifications on the applicability of laws.

### STANCE OF LAW ON PROTECTING MALES AGAINST FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS:

While the law primarily focuses on protecting women from domestic violence, acknowledging the patriarchal structure of society, it's also critical to recognize that men can be victims of domestic abuse. However, the current legal framework in India offers limited recourse for men suffering from domestic violence, highlighting a need for a more gender-neutral approach in legislation and legal protection against domestic abuse.
