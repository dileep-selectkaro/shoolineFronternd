# State under Article 12 & Judiciary as State under Article 12

## Introduction to State under Article 12

Article 12 of the Indian Constitution defines "The State" in the context of Fundamental Rights. It is crucial to understand this definition as it forms the foundation for enforcing these rights.

### Definition of "The State"

Article 12 includes:
1. The Government and Parliament of India.
2. The Government and Legislature of each State.
3. All local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.

### Expansive Interpretation

The term "includes" in Article 12 indicates that the definition is not exhaustive. The courts have extended the definition through judicial interpretations. Key elements include:
- Government and Parliament of India (Executive and Legislature).
- Government and Legislature of each State.
- All local and other authorities within the territory of India.
- Authorities under the control of the Government of India.

### Instrumentalities of the State

Instrumentalities are entities through which the State carries out its duties. For instance, Article 298 provides for the authority to conduct business and trade. The theory of instrumentality suggests that organizations carrying out these duties are considered embodiments of the State.

### Tests for "Other Authority"

In the case of **R. D. Shetty Vs International Airport Authority (1979)**, the Supreme Court laid down five tests to determine if an entity is an "other authority":
1. Entire share capital is owned or managed by the State.
2. Enjoys a monopoly status.
3. Department of Government is transferred to the Corporation.
4. Functional character is governmental in essence.
5. Deep and pervasive State control.

### Statutory Corporations

In **Sukdev Singh & Ors. Vs. Bhagat Ram & Anr. (1975)**, the Supreme Court ruled that statutory corporations like ONGC, IFC, and LIC are considered the State under Article 12 due to their statutory authority and significant government control.

## Judiciary as State under Article 12

### Judicial vs Non-Judicial Functions

- **Judicial Functions**: Courts are not included as "State" when performing their judicial functions. Judicial decisions are aimed at resolving disputes and cannot be contested as violations of Fundamental Rights under Article 13.
- **Non-Judicial Functions**: When courts act administratively or quasi-judicially, they can be considered as part of the State.

### Key Judicial Cases

- **Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra (1967)**: The Supreme Court held that judicial decisions by judges in matters before them cannot affect citizens' fundamental rights.
- **Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commissioner**: The Supreme Court ruled that the right to file a petition under Article 32 is fundamental and cannot be restricted.

### Challenges to Judicial Decisions

- **Certiorari Writ**: Can be issued against bodies acting judicially or quasi-judicially.
- **Judicial Conduct**: Judges are subject to provisions under Article 15(2)(b) and Article 17, ensuring they do not act in violation of fundamental rights.

### Remedies

- **Final Judicial Decisions**: Appeals or reviews before appellate courts are the appropriate remedies, not writ petitions based on fundamental rights violations.

## Conclusion

Understanding the broad definition of "The State" under Article 12 is essential for protecting Fundamental Rights. While the judiciary is involved in defining these rights, their judicial decisions, unless administrative, are generally not contestable under Article 32 or Article 226.
