# Transfer Petition

A Transfer Petition is a request filed with a court to move a case from one court to another. This petition can be submitted by any party involved in the case, who must demonstrate valid grounds for the transfer. Sections 22 to 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) govern the transfer and withdrawal of suits, appeals, and other proceedings. Sections 406 to 408 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) address the transfer of criminal cases and appeals.

## Section 22 of CPC - Procedure to File a Transfer Petition

- **Filing the Application:** The application for transfer must be made before the resolution of the issues between the parties.
- **Notice to Opposing Party:** Once submitted, the court must notify the opposing party.
- **Court’s Decision:** The court will consider the objections and arguments from both parties to decide the appropriate jurisdiction for the suit.

## Section 23 of CPC - Jurisdiction

- **Common Appellate Court:** If multiple courts have inferior jurisdiction but fall under the same appellate court, the application should be filed before that appellate court.
- **Same High Court:** If the courts are inferior to different appellate courts but under the same High Court, the application must be filed with that High Court.
- **Different High Courts:** If the courts are under different High Courts, the application must be submitted to the High Court within whose jurisdiction the original court is located.

## Section 24 - Notice and Suo Moto Transfer

- **Notice Requirement:** Upon receiving a transfer application, the court must serve notice to all parties and hear their objections.
- **Suo Moto Power:** District Judges or High Courts can transfer cases to an inferior court even without a formal application.

## Section 25 of CPC - Supreme Court’s Transfer Authority

- **Application for Transfer:** Any party can apply to the Supreme Court for transfer.
- **Notice and Hearing:** The Supreme Court must notify all parties and hear arguments before deciding.
- **Grounds for Transfer:** Transfer is justified if necessary for the ends of justice, facilitating interstate jurisdiction.

## Conditions for Transfer

### Allowed Conditions

- **Reasonable Apprehension of Injustice:** Transfer is allowed if there’s fear of bias or a charged atmosphere, as in *Raghunandan v. G. H. Chawla*.
- **Balance of Convenience:** Cases may be transferred for convenience and location of property, as in *Jotendro Nath v. Raj Kristo*.
- **Avoiding Multiplicity and Conflict:** To prevent conflicting decisions on the same issue, as held in *Rajulu v. Govindan*.
- **Common Questions of Fact and Law:** Cases involving common questions may be tried together, as in *Purna Chandra v. Samantha*.
- **Judge’s Interest in One Party:** Transfer is considered if there is reasonable justification, as in *Gujarat Electricity Board & Anr v. Atmaram Sungomal Poshani*.

### Not Allowed Conditions

- **Mere Convenience:** Convenience alone is insufficient for transfer, as in *Indian Overseas Bank v. Chemical Construction Co.*.
- **Judge’s Remarks on Merits:** Judges' opinions on the case merits do not justify transfer, as in *Gujarat Electricity Board & Anr vs Atmaram Sungomal Poshani*.
- **Erroneous Orders:** Erroneous orders do not imply bias, as per *Madan Lal v. Babul Lal*.
- **Opponent’s Influence:** Influence of an opponent in the locality may not warrant transfer, as in *Dr. Subramaniam Swamy v. Ramakrishna Hegde*.
- **Distance from Residence:** Distance from the applicant’s residence is not a strong ground for transfer, as seen in *Arvee Industries v. Rata Lal*.

## Procedure to File a Transfer Petition under CrPC

- **Affidavit Requirement:** An affidavit stating the grounds for transfer must be submitted in accordance with Section 297 of the CrPC.
- **Notice to Public Prosecutor:** Under Section 407(5), the accused must notify the Public Prosecutor in writing of the application. No order should be made without at least 24 hours’ notice.

## Section 406 of CrPC - Supreme Court’s Transfer Power

- **Discretionary Power:** The Supreme Court can transfer cases or appeals without requiring conclusive proof of reasons. An affidavit or affirmative motion is needed unless filed by the Attorney General or Advocate General.
- **Eligibility for Transfer:** Individuals fearing injustice, or those who believe they won’t receive fair justice, can apply, along with the Attorney General or Advocate General of India.

## Section 408 - Power of Sessions Judge to Transfer Cases

- **Discretionary Transfer:** The Sessions Judge can transfer cases within their jurisdiction to serve justice, based on reports or applications by parties.
- **Conditions for Transfer:** Transfer may be based on the discretion of the judge, reports from lower courts, or applications by interested parties.

## Conclusion

The transfer of cases is a critical mechanism in Indian law, ensuring justice is served. Parties seeking transfer must provide strong, reasonable grounds, while courts should use this power with discretion and in the interest of justice to ensure fair trials and justice delivery.
