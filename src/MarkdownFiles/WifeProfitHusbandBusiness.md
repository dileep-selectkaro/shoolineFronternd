# CAN WIFE SEEK SHARE IN PROFITS FROM HUSBAND’S FAMILY RUN BUSINESS?
### By Vaishnavi Kakumani

## HMA SECTION 25: PERMANENT ALIMONY AND MAINTENANCE
(1) Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent’s own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant, the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent.

## AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE (SECTION 23)
Section 23 of the Act provides the amounts of maintenance which a person is entitled to. It is at the discretion of the Court to determine whether any, and if so what, maintenance shall be awarded under the provisions of this Act. The amount of maintenance, whether fixed by a decree of court or by agreement, either before or after the commencement of this Act, may be altered subsequently if there is a material change in the circumstances justifying such alteration.

The means and capacity of a person against whom the award has to be made should be taken into consideration for determining the quantum of maintenance. The Supreme Court bench in the case of *Rajnesh vs Neha* has framed guidelines on the issue of maintenance, covering overlapping jurisdiction under different enactments for payment of maintenance, criteria for determining the quantum of maintenance, and enforcement of orders of maintenance.

There are instances where the husband is also a part of a family-run business hence derives extra money from the profits which isn’t a part of his personal income. In such cases too, the wife is entitled to a fair maintenance keeping in mind the lifestyle of the husband i.e. not only his individual income but also from the companies he owns. The Bombay High court, in the case of *Shirish H. Garg vs Nidhi S. Garg* on 16 November 2010, held that “The ascertainment of the income has to be done judiciously and sensibly. It cannot be done arbitrarily or only arithmetically."

In another case, *Pinky W/O. Mahendra Kumar Jain vs The State Of Maharashtra And Anr* on 6 October 2017, the Court had taken into consideration the husband’s family business income before deciding the fairness of maintenance.

The High Court of Bombay, in *Nita v. Hitendrakumar Kaluram Sakariya*, considered the respondent being an owner of a family jewellery shop and directed the respondent to pay maintenance, indicating the influence of family business income on maintenance decisions.

*Chandaram Bunkar Vs Smt. Ramadevi* highlighted that maintenance may be awarded up to the extent of 1/5th of the income of the spouse, illustrating the court's discretion in determining maintenance amounts based on the spouse's income, including potential earnings from family businesses.

A wife as a homemaker contributes significantly to the acquisition of family assets by performing household chores round-the-clock. The Madras High Court stated that her assistance cannot be discounted as valueless and she would be entitled to an equal share in her husband's properties, acknowledging the symbiotic relationship between the homemaking contributions of a wife and the husband's capability to earn.

From the above cases, it can be inferred that the quantum of maintenance varies from case to case, and there is no hard and fast rule on how to determine maintenance. However, in cases where the husband has underreported income or is a part of a family business, a wife’s maintenance can be increased as the husband’s role and the profits drawn from the business also need to be considered.
