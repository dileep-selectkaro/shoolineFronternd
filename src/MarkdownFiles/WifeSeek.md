# CAN WIFE SEEK SHARE IN PROFITS FROM HUSBAND’S FAMILY RUN BUSINESS?

**By Vaishnavi Kakumani**

## HMA SECTION 25: PERMANENT ALIMONY AND MAINTENANCE:

1. Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent’s own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant, the conduct of the parties, and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent.

## AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE (SECTION 23):

- Section 23 of the Act provides the amounts maintenance which a person is entitled to.
  1. It shall be in the discretion of the Court to determine whether any, and if so what, maintenance shall be awarded under the provisions of this Act. The amount payable by way of maintenance depends on the facts of each case and as such, no exception could be taken to the amount fixed by the trial Court as well as the date from which the maintenance could be claimed.
  2. The amount of maintenance, whether fixed by a decree of court or by agreement, either before or after the commencement of this Act, may be altered subsequently if there is a material change in the circumstances justifying such alteration.
  3. The means and capacity of a person against whom the award has to be made should be taken into consideration for determining the quantum of maintenance. In fact, in the case of the husband, it is not only the actual earning but also his potential earning capacity, which must be considered. There is a presumption that every able-bodied person has a capacity to earn and maintain his wife. The income of the husband is a significant factor to be considered by the court in fixing the quantum of maintenance. It is disposable income and not the gross income, which is to be considered.

## Section 23(2) of HAM ACT states the factors to be considered in determining the amount of maintenance payable to the wife, children, and aged parents, and they are as follows:
- The position and status of the parties.
- The reasonable wants of the claimant.
- Whether the claimant, if living separately, is justified or not.
- The income of the claimant and the value of the claimant’s property.
- The number of persons entitled to maintenance under the Act.

The Supreme Court bench in the case of Rajnesh vs Neha has framed guidelines on the issue of maintenance, which would cover overlapping jurisdiction under different enactments for payment of maintenance, payment of Interim Maintenance, the criteria for determining the quantum of maintenance, the date from which maintenance is to be awarded, and enforcement of orders of maintenance. The present legislations dealing with the issue of maintenance are Section 125 of the Cr.P.C, 1973; Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; Special Marriage Act, 1954; Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956; and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

## Maintenance in Family Business Context:

- There are instances where the husband also is a part of a family-run business hence derives extra money from the profits which isn’t a part of his personal income. In such cases too, the wife is entitled to a fair maintenance, keeping in mind the lifestyle of the husband, i.e., not only is the individual income but also from the companies he owns. The Bombay High Court, in the case of Shirish H. Garg vs Nidhi S. Garg on 16 November, 2010 held that “The ascertainment of the income has to be done judiciously and sensibly. It cannot be done arbitrarily or only arithmetically. The consideration of the income contemplated under the Section does not mean that only the numerical figures shown in the income tax returns of a party can be taken for the gospel.”

- In another case, Pinky W/O. Mahendra Kumar Jain vs The State Of Maharashtra And Anr on 6 October, 2017, the Court had taken into consideration the husband’s family business income before deciding the fairness of maintenance.

- In another case, the High Court of Bombay while dealing with other issues, in Nita v. Hitendrakumar Kaluram Sakariya was of the opinion that the respondent, being an owner of a family jewellery shop, held that “Keeping that view and having considered the background of the family from which the respondent comes from and looking at their family business so also his income in 1994, as stated by him, in his examination-in-chief, we deem it appropriate to direct the respondent to pay Rs. 5000/- each to the appellant and her son Aniket from the date of this order. This shall not preclude the appellant, if so advised, from seeking enhancement of the maintenance amount in accordance with law.”

## Notable Cases:

1. **Chandaram Bunkar Vs Smt. Ramadevi**: Quantum of maintenance may be awarded up to the extent of Rs. 1/5th of the income of the spouse. Husband was drawing a salary of about Rs. 35,000/- per month and an amount of Rs. 3,000/- per month had been awarded by way of maintenance to life. After retirement, the husband was drawing provisional pension of Rs. 15,115/- per month. The order of the Family Court maintaining the amount of Rs. 3,000 as maintenance to the wife even after the husband's retirement was not improper.

2. **Madras High Court**: A wife as a homemaker contributes to the acquisition of family assets by performing household chores round-the-clock; hence, her assistance cannot be discounted as valueless, and she would be entitled to an equal share in her husband’s properties, the Madras High Court said. Justice Krishnan Ramasamy observed that a husband could not have done his job and earned money without his wife’s support in taking care of his family.

From the above cases, it can be inferred that the quantum of maintenance varies from case to case and there is no hard and fast rule on how to determine maintenance. Although in cases where the husband has falsely shown income reports or is a part of a family business, a wife’s maintenance can be increased as the husband’s role and the profits drawn from the business also need to be taken into consideration.
