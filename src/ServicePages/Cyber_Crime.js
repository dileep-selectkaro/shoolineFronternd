        <h2>Cyber Crime AND Cyber Crimes Lawyer</h2>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>
          When it comes to smartphone users worldwide, India is ranked second.
          Following the widespread use of the internet in India, this number
          increased. People own the internet, regardless of their level of
          literacy, and utilising it has become doable for 2-3 year olds thanks
          to artificial intelligence and adapted technology. And this has
          significantly contributed to the surge in crime in the online
          community. Cybercrime is the umbrella term for offences committed
          online. In India, the legal expert handling the cases is referred to
          as a "cyber crime lawyer."

        <h2>Cyber Laws of India</h2>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>
          Simply described, cybercrime is any illegal activity that uses a
          computer as a tool, a target, or both. Traditional criminal offences
          like theft, fraud, forgery, defamation, and mischief—all of which are
          punishable under the Indian Penal Code—can also take the form of
          cybercrimes. The Information Technology Act of 2000 addresses a wide
          range of new age crimes that have been created as a result of computer
          abuse.
        </p>
        <p>Cybercrimes can be divided into two categories -</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a computer to attack another computer is known as "the
            computer as a target." For instance, a DOS attack, a virus or worm
            attack, etc.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Utilising a computer as a weapon—committing actual crimes while
            using one. such as pornography, IPR violations, credit card fraud,
            EFT fraud, and cyber-terrorism.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The phrase "cyber law," often known as "cyberlaw," is used to refer to
          the legal concerns associated with the use of communications
          technology, particularly "cyberspace," or the Internet. The
          intersection of numerous legal topics, including as intellectual
          property, privacy, freedom of expression, and jurisdiction, makes it
          less of a discrete area of law than, say, contract or property. Cyber
          law essentially represents an effort to reconcile the issues raised by
          human activity on the Internet with the historical legal framework
          that governs the real world.
