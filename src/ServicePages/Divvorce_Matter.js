            attempts to strike a balance between clients' legal and private

              <h2>MUTUAL CONSENT DIVORCE</h2>
              <hr></hr>
              <p>
                The Indian Parliament amended the Hindu Marriage Act in 1976 to
                provide for mutual consent divorce. It has provided comfort. In
                comparison to disputed divorce, we advise choosing mutual
                divorce. Time, effort, money, and toxic waste are all saved. The
                procedure of starting a mutual divorce, the role of the court,
                the terms and conditions of such a divorce, the duration of such
                a divorce, the location of filing, and other related problems
                always confound the parties. The next paragraphs address all of
                your questions.
              </p>

              <h2>First Step towards mutual consent divorce</h2>
              <hr></hr>
              <p>
                Couples should discuss their future plans together. If both
                partners decide that their marriage cannot function, they should
                defuse the stress in their immediate environment. They ought to
                embrace the fact that their marriage is over. Forget about your
                social anxiety. The husband and wife themselves are the best
                qualified to assess the problem.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Recognize that even amid conflict, there can be agreement.
              </p>

              <h2>Custody of Children in Mutual Consent Divorce</h2>
              <p>
                If there are children involved, the spouses should agree on the
                children's visitation rights and custody arrangements together.
                During the summer, winter, and other breaks, they can talk about
                interim custody. Equally capable of raising the children are
                both parents. What ultimately prevails is the parties'
                understanding and agreement. In a divorce based on mutual
                consent, the parties may agree to joint custody or shared
                parenting. By doing this, parents and kids can avoid unnecessary
                misery.

                Financial Disbursement in a Divorce by Mutual Consent
                <br />
                <br />
                A financial settlement is the next crucial component. There are
                many different components of financial settlement, such as
                alimony, maintenance, housing costs, higher education costs,
                costs associated with

                as mutual consent divorce attorneys. As attorneys for mutual
                consent divorce, we present many solutions while utilising our
                depth of expertise to achieve resolution. Sometimes, the level

              <h2>An outline of the mutual consent divorce process</h2>
              <hr></hr>
              <h3>Initial Motion</h3>
              <p>
                Following the filing of the petition for divorce by mutual
                consent, the parties must both be present in court for the
                statement to be recorded. One of the parties may present through
                a power of attorney if the other is unable to attend. A family
                member of the spouse should ideally serve as this power of
                attorney. It is customary to refer to the recording of the
                declaration as the First Motion having been adopted.
              </p>
              <h3>Second Motion</h3>
              <p>
                Parties are required to wait six months after the first motion
                has been approved before submitting a petition for the second
                move. This time frame can be extended for up to 18 months. The
                term "cooling- off phase" typically refers to this six-month
                interval. The parties have a six-month window to reconsider
                their relationship. It is offered in order to reconcile. The
                Court notes each party's statement. Once the statement covering
                a minimum of six months has been recorded, the Court grants the
                second motion. After then, a divorce decree is issued. A
                marriage is ended.
              </p>

              <h2>Time Exemption and Cooling-Off Period</h2>
              <p>
                The concerned family court may request a waiver of this
                six-month period by submitting an application. The period may be
                waived at the Family Court's discretion. As a result, a
                six-month term can be eliminated or shortened to as little as 15
                days or a month.
                <br />
                Both parties are free to withdraw their permission for divorce
                during the six-month window, or before bringing the second
                motion.

                  Contested divorce calls for lateral thinking and experience.
                  When a divorce is contested, the parties involved go to the
                  relevant Family Court to dissolve the marriage. The spouse
                  filing for divorce must use one of the legal grounds for a
                  contested divorce. For different segments of society, there
                  exist various laws governing contentious divorce. Hindus,
                  including followers of the Sikh, Jain, and Budh religions,
                  have grounds for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955.
                  Christian divorce is legal under the Indian Divorce Act of
                  1869. People who are married under civil law and whose
                  marriages are registered under the Special Marriage Act,1954,
                  have grounds for divorce under that act.

                  Each case has its own specific set of circumstances. Every
                  person is unique and different from another. There are
                  experiences, too. We have encountered and dealt with thousands
                  of contentious divorce cases during our nearly two-decade
                  journey. In order to better identify with the viewpoint of the
                  spouse seeking or opposing a contentious divorce, we have
                  practised and refined this skill. This strategy aids in
                  portraying the case in the light of the difficulties you
                  encountered as a married couple. We portray the case in
                  accordance with the evolving legal and judicial subtleties
                  since we are aware of them. As attorneys, we take this stance
                  but never forsake our obligation to act objectively while
                  keeping your best interests in mind. The fact that GROUNDS FOR
                  DIVORCE COMMONLY USED, we discovered that the main grounds for
                  contested divorces are CRUELTY, DESERTION, & ADULTERY
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let's quickly discuss what it means in the context of a
                  contentious divorce
                </p>
                <h6>
                  <b>Cruelty:</b>{" "}
                </h6>
                <p>
                  There is no legal definition for this expression. In
                  actuality, it cannot be defined. It's a relative term that
                  varies from person to person. This phrase must be understood
                  in the context of the parties involved, their backgrounds, and
                  levels of education. What might be cruel to one person might
                  not be to another. In general, it is the other spouse's
                  actions that make it challenging or unlikely for the other
                  spouse to be expected to live with that person. The idea of
                  cruelty as a basis for divorce has evolved as a result of
                  various court decisions. The Samara Ghosh ruling from the
                  prestigious Supreme Court gave out a list, albeit it is not
                  full, encompassing key aspect of cruelty.{" "}
                </p>
                <h6>
                  <b>Desertion:</b>{" "}
                </h6>
                <p>
                  In order to file for divorce on the basis of desertion, there
                  must have been a two-year period of continuous separation.
                  Separation does not, however, imply abandonment in and of
                  itself. The other spouse's unjustified departure from the
                  marriage must also be demonstrated. Furthermore, and this is
                  crucial, the spouse who is filing for divorce has made
                  attempts to mend fences and win back the other spouse.
                  Desertion refers to a spouse's intention to leave the marriage
                  with no plans to remarry or to recommit to it.{" "}
                </p>
                <h6>
                  <b>Adultery: </b>{" "}
                </h6>
                <p>
                  It simply indicates that the spouse who is the target of the
                  accusations engaged in physical contact with someone else.
                  Strict evidence is required by law in this case. Being
                  involved in a relationship with another person is distinct
                  from committing adultery. Participation in a relationship
                  without proof of infidelity may support a divorce claim based
                  on cruelty.

                <hr></hr>
                <p>
                  Divorce proceedings must include child custody law and its
                  subset, visiting rights. The most significant and difficult
                  problem is child custody. Both parties are prepared to win by
                  any margin in the courtroom, which resembles a battleground.
                  It seems as though both spouses are trying to prove the
                  other's guilt and culpability by using child custody as a
                  vehicle.

                  In a nutshell, we can state that while the court is deciding
                  the claims of the husband and wife about the kid, the welfare
                  of the child is the most important factor.

                  A good child custody lawyer in India is one who is able to
                  handle the emotional and psychological needs of either the
                  mother or the father. They should also be knowledgeable about
                  the laws, rules, and a wide range of cases. The legal and
                  emotional difficulties must be handled with the utmost
                  delicacy by a skilled child custody attorney. To successfully
                  argue the child custody case in court, the custody lawyer must
                  act not only as a professional but also as a human being with
                  the heart of a parent

                <h2>MAINTENANCE LAW IN INDIA</h2>
                <h6>Overview:</h6>
                <p>
                  The dictionary definition of maintenance is "support or
                  sustenance." The term "maintenance" is not defined in any of
                  the religious communities' marriage laws. However, the right
                  to claim maintenance is based on the assumption that the
                  claimant does not have sufficient means to support herself.
                  The expenses for necessaries or essentials for the substance
                  of life are generally covered by the maintenance. However, it
                  is more than just the claimant's right to survival. This is
                  clear from the pro visions of the aforementioned acts, which
                  provide guidelines to the court by stating the factors to be
                  considered when determining the amount of maintenance. To
                  determine the amount of maintenan ce, the court will consider
                  the husband's and wife's property possession, the husband's
                  ability to ear n, the parties' conduct, and other
                  circumstances. Before determining the amount of maintenance,
                  the parties' status and the standard of living they enjoy
                  during the duration of their marriage must be considered.
                </p>
                <h2>PROCEDURE FOR MAINTENANCE</h2>
                <hr></hr>
                <p>Interim Maintenance: </p>
                <p>
                  Such maintenance is provided while the case is pending in
                  court. The underlying principle behind such maintenance is
                  that one party should not lose and be on a weaker footing when
                  contesting the case. The amount of such maintenance is
                  determined by a number of factors, the most important of which
                  are the parties' pre-filing status and the income/salary of
                  the spouse against whom such maintenance is claimed. The court
                  always attempts to put both parties on an equal footing.

                  It is given when the entire case is finally resolved. It could
                  be monthly or quarterly, depending on the facts and
                  circumstances of the case
                </p>
                <h2>CASE OF LAWS GOVERNING MAINTENANCE</h2>
                <hr></hr>
                <p>
                  In India, various laws govern various aspects of maintenance.
                  These laws are classified as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Section 125 Cr.P.C Maintenance</li>
                  <li>Section 24 Hindu Marriage Act </li>
                  <li>Section 18 Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act </li>
                  <li>Provisions under the Domestic Violence Act</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Each case and situation necessitates the initiation of a
                  proceeding under any of the preceding laws. Maintenance claims
                  are sometimes filed under more than one law. As a result, the
                  petitioner may file a claim for maintenance under more than
                  one provision, such as section 125 Cr.P.C. and section 24 of
                  the Hindu Marriage Act. In practise, the law holds that if two
                  courts award different amounts of maintenance to the wife, the
                  Petitioner is entitled to higher maintenance. However, the
                  wife will not be entitled to total maintenance from both
                  courts. Thus, if the court grants 20,000 rupees in 125 Crp.C
                  proceedings but only 15000 per month in Section 24
                  proceedings, the wife will be evicted. entitled to Rs.20,000
                  rather than Rs.35,000 per month The greater amount must be
                  paid and is not cumulative.
                </p>
                <h2>WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO FILE A MAINTENANCE CASE?</h2>
                <hr></hr>
                <p>
                  The following people may bring a case for maintenance in a
                  marriage matter:

                <p>
                  {" "}
                  In India, maintenance isn't determined using a set formula.
                  Laying is tricky. The Supreme Court has ruled that it must be
                  at least 25% of the husband's salary. Additionally, the
                  Annurita case formula is frequently used, which states that
                  after equally allocating the family's income among all
                  members, earning members are entitled to one extra piece of
                  themselves. It is safe to assume that maintenance can range
                  from a lower range of 20% to roughly 30% of the income.

                  Financial disclosure of each party's assets and liabilities is
                  needed. In Rajnesh v. Neha, the Hon. Supreme Court of India
                  mandated that each spouse provide an affidavit of income
                  outlining all sources of income, expenses, liabilities, etc.
