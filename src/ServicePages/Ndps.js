          <h2>Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985</h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, or NDPS Act, is
            a law passed by the Indian Parliament in 1985 that makes it illegal
            to produce, manufacture, cultivate, possess, sell, buy, transport,
            store, use, or consume any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance.
            On August 23, 1985, the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha. Both
            Houses of Parliament approved it, the then-President Giani Zail
            Singh gave his assent on September 16, 1985, and it went into effect
            on November 14, 1985. Since then, the NDPS Act has undergone four
            revisions: in 1988, 2001, 2014, and 2021. The Act covers the
            entirety of India, as well as all Indian nationals living abroad and
            everyone on ships and aeroplanes with Indian registrations. With
            effect from March 1986, the statute created the Narcotics Control
            Bureau. The Act is intended to fulfil India's duties under the
            United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
            and Psychotropic Substances, the Convention on Psychotropic
            Substances, and the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The NDPS
            act of 1985 consists of 83 Sections and 6 Chapters. Anyone who
            violates the NDPS Act shall be punished according to the amount of
            the prohibited substance they used.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              where the violation only involves a minor amount, strict
              imprisonment for a time that may last up to a year, a fine that
              may reach 10,000 (US$130), or both;
            </li>
            <li>
              when the violation involves a quantity that is higher than a small
              amount but less than a commercial quantity, with strict
              imprisonment for a time that may last up to 10 years and with a
              fine that may reach 1 lakh (US$1,300);{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              if the violation involves a commercial quantity, strict
              imprisonment for a time that must not be less than 10 years but
              may go as high as 20 years, as well as a fine that must not be
              less than 1 lakh rupees ($1,300) but may go as high as 2 lakh
              rupees ($2,500).

            The Act's Section 8 specifically outlaws the cultivation of opium,
            poppy, coca, or cannabis plants as well as the manufacturing,
            distribution, storage, and acquisition of illegal narcotics and
            psychoactive drugs. The legislation also outlaws feeding, housing,
            and financing convicted offenders. In accordance with Section 19,
            any farmer who grows opium lawfully and with a permit but steals it
            might spend up to 20 years in prison and be fined between Rs. 1-2
            lakh. Penalties for the sale, purchase, transport, import, export,
            possession, and use of narcotic narcotics and psychotropic
            substances, such as poppy straw, prepared opium, opium poppy,
            cannabis, etc. include: a. 1 year in prison and/or a fine of up to
            10,000 rupees in the case of minor quantities. However, the
            punishment would be much less severe if marijuana was involved. This
            means that individuals may receive prison terms of one to five years
            and fines that range from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. In any of the
            aforementioned circumstances, the court has the authority to punish
            offenders by outlining the justification for the increased fee in
            the judgement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The severity of the penalty for illegally importing, exporting, or
            transshipping drugs, psychoactive substances, or both, is determined
            by how much of the substance is involved. According to Section 24,
            anyone who violates the Act by engaging in external transactions
            would be punished with a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum
            of 20 years in prison as well as a fine between Rs.1 LAKH TO 2 LAKH
            Any individual whose property is used to commit any offence under
            the Act faces a sentence of harsh imprisonment of at least 10 years
            and up to 20 years, as well as a fine of at least 1 lakh rupees and
            at most 2 lakh rupees. Anyone who supports or finances criminal
            action by others should face the same sanctions, regardless of their
            position. If someone used a narcotic drug or a psychoactive drug,
            the punishment would vary depending on the substance used. For
            people who use drugs like cocaine, morphine, or diacetylmorphine,
            harsh incarceration consists of a year in jail and/or a fine of up
            to Rs 20,000. If the offender uses any other substance during the
            proceedings, they would receive a sentence of six months to a year
            in jail and a fine of Rs. 10,000. Any prisoner who is using drugs
            has the right to be moved to a treatment centre by a court. Agents
            who seize illegal drugs must destroy them properly as directed. The
            accused's illegal property is seized by the authorities. The
            National Fund for the Regulation of Drug Abuse will be established
            with the proceeds from the sale of property obtained illegally, and
            it will use these proceeds to support efforts to restrict drug use
            as well as the treatment of drug addicts.

          <h2>Repeat Offenders Will Face More Serious Penalties</h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            People who regularly misuse drugs face harsher penalties under the
            Act because they are more likely to do so. Multiple offences might
            result in punishments that are up to 1.5 times more harsh. As a
            result, the term for an offence can be anything from 1.5 years in
            prison to 30 years. In other words, a second conviction would result
            in a sentence that was up to 1.5 times the first one. A second
            conviction is punishable by the death penalty under Section 31A of
            the Act. A person sentenced to death after a second conviction for a
            crime involving at least a certain amount of drugs was required by
            the Act prior to the 2014 modification. Opium has a cutoff weight of
            10 kg, while heroin and morphine have a threshold weight of 1 kg.
            Me. of the Act stipulates that a second conviction will result in
            the death penalty. A person sentenced to death after a second
            conviction for a crime involving at least a certain amount of drugs
            was required by the Act prior to the 2014 modification. Opium has a
            cutoff weight of 10 kg, while heroin and morphine have a threshold
            weight of 1 kg.Me The 2014 amendment, which made it very clear that
            death can be substituted for any of the other penalties mentioned in
            the Act for a second offender, was praised by several human rights
            organisations. Many academics have repeatedly argued that the NDPS
            Act should be amended to completely eliminate the death sentence. An
            estimated 32 countries have drug laws that permit the death penalty
            in exceptional circumstances. Studies on how the death penalty
            affects drug markets in these countries, however, show that it is
            ineffective at deterring covert drug activity.

          <h2>Aspects of the NDPS Act that are preventative</h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            The NDPS Act gives important law enforcement agencies the power to
            crack down on drug use. The NDPS Act enacts measures against
            needless harassment for citizens. When making an arrest or taking a
            seizure under the Act, law enforcement officials are required to
            create a thorough report with all relevant information and send it
            to their supervisor. According to Section 100 of the CRPC,
            authorities are required to search suspect-concealing subjects in
            front of two credible local inhabitants. An inspection report
            detailing the contents of the search and seizure is given to the
            accused. The police officer who seizes the illegal substances is
            required by the NDPS Act to preserve them in a safe place. On all
            search warrants, a trustworthy seal is applied to confirm that the
            arresting officer has taken possession of the object and the officer
            in charge of the police station. The Act's "Search Procedure" clause
            gives the accused the right to have their property searched while a
            magistrate or gazette officer is present. The Supreme Court ruled in
            State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh 1994 AIR 1872 that the police
            officer must inform the accused of this privilege in order to
            maintain it. Violations of the legislation imposed under Section 58
            will result in harsh consequences for the complainants. Are you
