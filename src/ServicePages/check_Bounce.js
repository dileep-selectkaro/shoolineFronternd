        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          The current Act has a lengthy history. The 3rd Indian Law Commission
          first developed the Act in 1866. It was presented to the Council in
          December 1867 and referred to a Select Committee. The mercantile
          community objected to the numerous departures from the English Law
          that it included. In 1877, the Bill needed to be revised. The Bill was
          amended by a Select Committee when enough time had passed for local
          governments, high courts, and chambers of commerce to voice their
          concerns. Despite this, Bill was unable to go to the last stage. The
          Bill had to be sent to a new Law Commission in 1880 by order of the
          Secretary of State. The Bill was revised in response to the new Law
          Commission's recommendations, and it was once again referred to a
          Select Committee, which embraced the majority of the additions
          suggested by the new Law Commission. The Negotiable Instruments Act,
          1881, was created after the draught was written for the fourth time
          and presented to the Council (Act No.26 of 1881). <br />
          <br />
          The name "Hundi" refers to the most significant type of credit
          instruments to develop in India. The twelfth century saw the height of
          their use, which has persisted to the present day. They are the oldest
          type of credit instrument still in existence. These were employed as
          remittance instruments for the purpose of transferring money from one
          location to another; they were utilised in trade and credit
          transactions. Hundi were used as traveler's checks throughout the
          modern era.
          <br />
          <br />
          A promissory note, bill of exchange, or check payable to order or to
          bearer is a "negotiable instrument," as defined under Section 13 of
          the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, Section 1 also mentions the
          local scope, Commencement, and Saving of Usage Relating to Hundis. The
          Indian Paper Currency Act, 1871, Section 21, and any local usage
          relating to any instrument in an oriental language are unaffected by
          this, even if it applies to all of India. Providing, however, that any
          language in the body of the instrument that indicates an intention
          that the legal relations of the parties thereto shall be controlled by
          this Act may exclude such usages; and it shall come into force when:
          <br />
          <br />
          Main Types of Negotiable Instruments are:
          <ul>
            <li>Inland Instruments</li>
            <li>Foreign Instruments</li>
            <li>Bank</li>
            <li>Finance companies(listed) Draft</li>

        <h2>Modern Day</h2>

        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          Instead of carrying cash equal to the value of the check, we prefer
          to carry a small piece of paper called a check. Before 1988, there
          was no legal framework in place to prevent someone from issuing a
          check without having enough money in their account to cover it. Of
          course, a civil liability has been accrued for a dishonoured check. By
          revising the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881 with the Negotiable
          Instruments Act of 1988, a criminal remedy of penalty was added to
          provide promptitude and remedy against the defaulters of the
          Negotiable Instrument.
          <br />
          <br />
          The situation improved after these provisions were added to the Act,
          and instances of dishonour have decreased somewhat, but because
          different High Courts have applied different interpretive strategies
          to various Act provisions, the situation has become even more
          complicated. Nevertheless, when it comes to check dishonour, the
          trends of the Supreme Court of India's decisions have improved the
          situation.
          <br />
          <br />
          To close the gaps, Parliament passed the Negotiable Instruments
          (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 (55 of 2002). The
          parent Act is touched by five new provisions from 143 to 147 as well
          as check truncation using digital means, and the amendment Act went
          into effect on February 6, 2003.

        <h2>Review And Reform</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        In order to make doing business easier and lower incarceration rates,
        the Finance Ministry of the Government of India suggested the
        decriminalisation of a number of white-collar offences in June 2020,
        including check bouncing under Section 138 of the Negotiable
        Instruments Act. The idea has been opposed by a number of trade and
        industry organisations, including the Confederation of All-India Traders
        (CAIT), the Indian Banks' Association and Finance Industry Development
        Council (FIDC), and the Federation of Industrial and Commercial
        Organisation (FICO) .

          Section 138, NI Act: Position of Law on Cheque Bounce and Punishment
          in India
        </h2>
        <h4>Introduction -</h4>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          The Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881 was revised in 1988, and
          Section 138 was added, making the bounce of checks a criminal offence
          punishable by up to two years in prison, a fine up to double the value
          of the check, or both. By amending the legislation in 1988 to include
          Section 138, the major goal was to foster trust in the effectiveness
          of banking operations and credibility while conducting business using
          negotiable instruments to prevent dishonest checks from being issued
          by the drawer. The following are the elements necessary to comply with
          Section 138 as stated in Kusum Ignots and Alloys ltd. v. Pennar
          Peterson Securities Ltd.
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              A check is issued to pay off a debt or other liability that a
              person (who will be the drawer of the check) owes to another
              person (who will be the payee or holder of the check, as the case
              may be).{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              check is returned because there aren't enough funds, or it
              exceeds the amount the bank agreed to pay. 3. The check must be
              submitted within six months of the day it was drawn or until it
              expires, whichever comes first.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Within 30 days of receiving notification from the bank about the
              failure to pay a check, the drawer is provided a written notice.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              15 days after receiving written notice from the drawer, the payee
              or holder has not received the payment.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>checks covered under this Section</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          he definition of a check is found in Section 6 of the Act, however
          there have been cases in which some checks issued for different
          reasons fell within this definition and others did not. The courts
          have explicitly stated in numerous decisions that blank checks without
          a date or signature would not fall under the definition of a check as
          stated in section 138. In Hari Ram Sariwala v State of Jharkhand, The
          High Court dismissed the section 138 complaint on the grounds that
          writing the amount and date on a check constitutes a material change.
          Due to the fact that the appellant was unable to demonstrate that a
          blank check had been given to him, the court declared the check
          invalid and ignored Section 138 even though the drawer owed the
          appellant money. In the cases of M.S. Narayana Menon versus the State
          of Kerala3 and Sudhir Kumar Bhalla versus Jagdish Chand, The Supreme
          Court explained that the Section 138 did not apply to checks issued as
          security since that provision only applied to checks drawn to pay off
          debts or other obligations. While pay orders and self-addressed
          checks, which are closer to a bill of exchange than a check and were
          drawn to discharge the drawer's responsibility as a guarantor, were
          taken into consideration under the scope of this provision.
        </p>
        <h2>Reasons for Dishonouring of checks</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          The major goal of Section 138 was to deter people from writing
          fraudulent checks. Therefore, in addition to dishonouring checks due
          to inadequate cash, there are other actions that might constitute the
          start of the offence.
          <br />
          <br />
          The majority of High Courts ruled that Section 138 will protect a
          drawer's termination of payment. The Supreme Court further confirmed
          that cases in which a drawer requested a bank to halt a payment to a
          payee with the intent to defraud would also fall under the purview of
          Section 138 of the Act. However, a simple notice to discontinue
          payments won't necessarily be considered a violation of Section 138.
          The Supreme Court outlined the distinction test in M.M.T.C Ltd. v.
          Medhel Chemicals & Pvt. Ltd. and held that if there was adequate money
          in the drawer's account and the check payment was halted for other
          legitimate reasons, that would not constitute an offence under Section
          138. When something is done before the payment due date, the Supreme
          Court has validated the reasons why it is not considered to be the
          start of an offence. Closing of bank accounts is another situation in
          which the Courts applied Section 138. Closing bank accounts results in
          a zero balance, which causes the bank to dishonour checks. Therefore,
          the punishment for beginning the offence described in Section 138 also
          applied to the closing of a bank account.
        </p>
        <h2>Offence under Section 138</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          The addition of Section 138 makes it illegal to dishonour checks owing
          to inadequate money. The offence is likewise victim-specific and, like
          in the IPC, both the offender and the offence are taken into
          consideration. However, when compared to those defined in IPC, there
          are some differences. It neither takes mens rea into account nor
          regards it equally to other crimes. Section 138's primary goal was to
          prevent dishonest people from writing checks. The Court acknowledged
          that there need not always be intention for dishonouring checks but
          did not view mens rea as a necessary component when establishing
          severe responsibility. 13 Therefore, if all other requirements are met
          and a person issues a check while being unaware of inadequate funds
          and it is returned for lack of funds, that person will be held
          accountable for the beginning of an offence. The severity of the
          offence under Section 138 is different from the offence under the IPC.
          In Kaushalya Devi Massand v. Roopkishore Khore, the court ruled that
          an offence under Section 138 is only given criminal undertones and
          cannot be compared to other offences that are defined by the IPC.
          Therefore, it may be claimed that the Section 138 offence is just a
          civil wrong that the Act defines as a criminal offence.

        <h2>Recent important Judgements</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>
          Mediation: In the matter of Dayawati v. Yogesh Kumar Gosain from 2017,
          the Delhi High Court considered whether a criminally compoundable
          offence under Section 138 might be resolved through mediation. In
          response, the Court affirmed the expeditious resolution of cases.
          Additionally, it specified the process to be followed in the
          settlement of the offence and noted that the scheme of prosecution is
          distinct from the CrPC because the offence is of a civil nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
        <hr style={{marginTop:"2px"}}></hr>
        <p style={{margin:"5PX"}}>The Supreme Court's landmark decision in the K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan16 case permitted five territorial jurisdictions. When the abuse of place of institution was being considered by the Supreme Court in 2014, it prohibited the holder or payee from filing cases in locations other than the banks where the dishonoured checks were to be drawn. Later, the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance 2015 was passed, overturning the geographical jurisdictional concept established in 2014. The former decision was statutorily overruled in 2016 by Bridgestone India Private Limited v. Inderpal Singh, which permitted the appellant to begin proceedings where the check was delivered.


          Speedy Disposal of cases and Dishonouring of checks:

          The Supreme Court stated in Meters and Instruments (P) Ltd. v. Kanchan Mehta19 that summary procedure should typically be used as the offence is of a civil character to expeditiously resolve cases after taking into account the large number of cases involving check dishonouring. Additionally, it provided an online mode for some processes.
          <br /><br />
          With the intention of discouraging the dishonest practise of issuing checks that were later voided for insufficient cash, Section 138 was included. The main prerequisites for filing a case are all the items listed in Kusum Ignots and Alloys Ltd. v. Pennar Peterson Securities. Although the act only specified two reasons—insufficient fund and exceeding amount—courts have taken into account situations when payments were stopped or accounts were closed because a drawer's issued checks were not honoured. In order to achieve a swift resolution in our contemporary period, the court now uses mediation and other strategies including online procedures. The Negotiable Instrument Act is not the only piece of legislation that must be referenced when a Cheque Bounces; also relevant are decisions made by the Supreme Court and High Court.</p>
